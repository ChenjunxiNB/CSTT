Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.88,0:01:15.14,英文,,0,0,0,,All right, so this is CS50.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.14,0:01:22.58,英文,,0,0,0,,My name is David Malan, and this is Harvard University's Introduction to the Intellectual Enterprises of Computer Science and the Art of Programming.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.58,0:01:30.01,英文,,0,0,0,,And this, of course, is our special family weekend, wherein not only are CS50's own students here in the audience, but also some family members as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.01,0:01:32.55,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, you're showing up in the semester a little bit late.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.55,0:01:37.77,英文,,0,0,0,,We've just tackled week eight, which is really our ninth week since computer scientists start counting from zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.77,0:01:45.93,英文,,0,0,0,,So we've done a whole lot of work over the past few weeks, as you might have heard via emails or text messages home, including a language known here as binary.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.93,0:01:48.39,英文,,0,0,0,,So on the screen here, of course, is a lot of 0's and 1's.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.39,0:01:54.33,英文,,0,0,0,,And suffice it to say, let me sum up the past nine weeks with, this is what's going on underneath the hood.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.33,0:01:58.95,英文,,0,0,0,,But of course, today, we thought we'd make things a little more accessible, a little more broadly applicable.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.95,0:02:04.25,英文,,0,0,0,,And indeed, our focus today will not be on what these patterns of 0's and 1's represent.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.25,0:02:10.10,英文,,0,0,0,,Which, in astute eye, might notice are replicated visually with these light bulbs being in a pattern on and off.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.10,0:02:17.50,英文,,0,0,0,,And as your child might have hinted before class or perhaps now, this might very well spell a word up to eight characters long.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.50,0:02:27.33,英文,,0,0,0,,Because you can encode, even in the real world, things digital too. But today, we'll focus on things much more high level, this notion of cybersecurity, like the security of our data,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.33,0:02:36.74,英文,,0,0,0,,our privacy of our systems, particularly on the internet nowadays, because presumably all of us are carrying technologies around in our pocket, using laptops and desktops every day.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.74,0:02:47.15,英文,,0,0,0,,And so the goal today is to not stipulate that this is what's going on underneath the hood, but let's solve some problems at a higher level
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.15,0:03:00.15,英文,,0,0,0,,so that your homework, when you go back to wherever you're visiting from, can actually be to apply some of today's lessons learned. So with that said, perhaps the most common familiar defense Of one's systems and data, phone and laptops and desktops would just be these simple passwords.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.15,0:03:05.03,英文,,0,0,0,,Unfortunately, you and I are, frankly, as humans, not all that good at choosing passwords.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.03,0:03:19.78,英文,,0,0,0,,And this is, in itself, a relatively weak form of defense, even though each of us has dozens, hundreds of passwords nowadays, or at least dozens or hundreds of accounts, maybe. Fives or tens of dozens of passwords.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.78,0:03:25.07,英文,,0,0,0,,Indeed, if you're in the habit of reusing passwords, we'll see today probably among our first lessons learned.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.07,0:03:39.79,英文,,0,0,0,,So for instance, if we look back at the past year, 2021, thanks to security researchers who take a look at data that has been hacked or leaked online by way of public databases, we have a sense, as computer scientists,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.79,0:03:44.17,英文,,0,0,0,,of what the most popular or equivalently, what some of the worst passwords are that you and I are choosing for our system.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.17,0:03:53.53,英文,,0,0,0,,So as of this past year, according to one measure, the most commonly used password in systems everywhere was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.53,0:04:00.93,英文,,0,0,0,,All right, number two password in our top 10 here list was only slightly longer, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.93,0:04:05.89,英文,,0,0,0,,After that, we took a turn in the other direction, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.89,0:04:15.92,英文,,0,0,0,,After that, got a little more interesting, QWERTY, which might sound pretty cryptic, but not if you look down at your US keyboard, and it's the top left-hand row of the keys on an American keyboard.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.92,0:04:18.38,英文,,0,0,0,,So also, not all that hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.38,0:04:25.40,英文,,0,0,0,,Perhaps not surprisingly, a little disconcertingly, number five was Password.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.40,0:04:29.30,英文,,0,0,0,,Meanwhile, number 6 returns us to digits. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.30,0:04:33.43,英文,,0,0,0,,After that, really less effort. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.43,0:04:37.85,英文,,0,0,0,,After that, a little more variation, but not all that much. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.85,0:04:42.05,英文,,0,0,0,,After that, it's getting even less interesting. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.05,0:04:45.51,英文,,0,0,0,,And then lastly, topping the list is just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.51,0:04:48.37,英文,,0,0,0,,So this is not a good top 10 list to be on.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.37,0:04:54.50,英文,,0,0,0,,So among today's first takeaways is if you see your password on this screen, you didn't make the list in a good way.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.50,0:04:59.40,英文,,0,0,0,,This means hundreds, thousands, millions of other people probably have that password of yours.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.40,0:05:05.90,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, in and of itself, that's not necessarily worrisome, because I don't know who has these passwords in a room as large as this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.90,0:05:09.62,英文,,0,0,0,,But just intuitively, why is this a bad thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.62,0:05:14.19,英文,,0,0,0,,Either parent or child, welcome to raise a hand here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.19,0:05:16.33,英文,,0,0,0,,Why might this be?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.33,0:05:18.91,英文,,0,0,0,,Intuitively, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.91,0:05:19.94,英文,,0,0,0,,So access to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.94,0:05:24.74,英文,,0,0,0,,I mean, we literally, as computer scientists now, have a database of really common passwords.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.74,0:05:28.97,英文,,0,0,0,,And your thoughts?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.97,0:05:30.71,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, you can just find it out quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.71,0:05:36.43,英文,,0,0,0,,I mean, you could imagine trying to guess someone's password by just typing in random letters, random numbers, random words.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.43,0:05:42.06,英文,,0,0,0,,But not if you have a top 10 list. Like, the adversaries in the world might as well just start with this list.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.06,0:05:44.92,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, you'll notice that even absent from this are slight variants.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.92,0:05:51.28,英文,,0,0,0,,Like, some of you might be thinking, I'm not on the list because I do something clever, like I use an exclamation point for the number 1.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:06:00.01,英文,,0,0,0,,or a 3 for an E or a 5 for an S. And based on the smiles in the room right now, you're not all that clever, it turns out, because other people are smiling too,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.01,0:06:09.01,英文,,0,0,0,,which is to say that an adversary can take those same heuristics that you might think are making things more secure by just tweaking some letters to numbers or vice versa.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.01,0:06:14.08,英文,,0,0,0,,But if you're doing it and other people are doing it, the bad guys, so to speak, are going to be doing it as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.08,0:06:21.52,英文,,0,0,0,,So unfortunately, when it comes to passwords, Better is longer and random and really unguessable, but that's not what most of us have.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.52,0:06:30.06,英文,,0,0,0,,In fact, case in point, on our phones, whether you have an Android device or an iPhone nowadays, odds are you have something relatively simplistic protecting it, if you have anything at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.06,0:06:34.79,英文,,0,0,0,,But at least Apple and Google are pretty good at at least nudging us to choose these kinds of passcodes now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.79,0:06:38.45,英文,,0,0,0,,And a four-digit passcode is quite common nowadays.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.45,0:06:57.58,英文,,0,0,0,,And so here's where we have an opportunity, thanks to the URL that you saw on the screen earlier, to conjecture as a group Just how long might it take an adversary, someone out there who's out to get us or get one of us, how long might it take an adversary to figure out your phone's four-digit passcode?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.58,0:07:01.60,英文,,0,0,0,,This is CS50's own Carter. Carter, if we could switch over and poll the audience here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.60,0:07:11.16,英文,,0,0,0,,If you take out your phone or laptop, whatever device you might have used a few minutes ago to scan that QR code or to visit that same URL,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.16,0:07:14.30,英文,,0,0,0,,You can see these questions on your browser.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.30,0:07:15.96,英文,,0,0,0,,And if you can't, that's fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.96,0:07:18.38,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll share some aggregate data nonetheless.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.38,0:07:20.80,英文,,0,0,0,,But you should have an opportunity to tap one of your answers.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.80,0:07:27.20,英文,,0,0,0,,And we'll give folks a few more seconds if you'd like to play along at home.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.20,0:07:30.81,英文,,0,0,0,,And here in just a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.81,0:07:34.87,英文,,0,0,0,,Probably have many people reporting, but why don't we go ahead and take a look at some percentages.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.87,0:07:39.34,英文,,0,0,0,,It looks like most of you, 67% are proposing just a few seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.34,0:07:42.50,英文,,0,0,0,,So that's not all that good news if it's a four-digit passcode.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.50,0:07:45.12,英文,,0,0,0,,Some of you are hoping it's a few minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.12,0:07:50.71,英文,,0,0,0,,8% are hoping a few hours. More than 4% of you are really hoping perhaps it's a few days.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.71,0:07:58.50,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, let's actually consider how we can answer this question and make today not just conceptual, but a little quantitative, too, and see if we can't slap some numbers on questions like these.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.50,0:08:01.76,英文,,0,0,0,,So ultimately, you can make more informed decisions with your system security.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.76,0:08:10.15,英文,,0,0,0,,So for instance, when it comes to four-digit passcodes, rather than just consider How secure it is, well, let's make it a more precise question.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.15,0:08:20.15,英文,,0,0,0,,Like, what are the forms of attack? Well, the simplest attack might be just someone grabbing your phone, be it in your family or maybe at Starbucks or the airport or the like, and just starting all possible combinations.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.15,0:08:26.57,英文,,0,0,0,,Maybe 0, 0, 0, 0, then 0, 0, 0, 1, and 0, 0, 0, 2. We could maybe automate this a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.57,0:08:32.60,英文,,0,0,0,,So for instance, I might potentially be able to do something like roboticize this here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.60,0:08:35.22,英文,,0,0,0,,Let me go ahead and full screen a quick video here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.22,0:08:44.16,英文,,0,0,0,,That's just going to paint a picture in just a moment on the screen of how, if we're a really clever adversary and know how to build things, well, at least maybe we could automate some of that process.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.16,0:08:46.56,英文,,0,0,0,,So here's an Android phone sitting on a counter.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.56,0:08:52.27,英文,,0,0,0,,Here's a very simple tripod and a little touch device robotically doing all of that hacking for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.27,0:08:56.35,英文,,0,0,0,,Starting at 0, 0, 0, 0, probably all the way up to 9, 9, 9, 9.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.35,0:08:59.44,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, that, too, wasn't necessarily all that fast.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.44,0:09:08.37,英文,,0,0,0,,But at least the adversary can step away and doesn't actually have to be bothered with the time involved, the cost involved in actually hacking that particular device.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.37,0:09:14.31,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, let's go one level deeper, a little more interestingly, and consider here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.31,0:09:20.13,英文,,0,0,0,,How much time, really, this so-called brute force attack would take. And that's actually a term of art.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.13,0:09:29.28,英文,,0,0,0,,Much like in yesteryear, when maybe there was a battering ram trying to brute force their way into a castle or something like that,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.28,0:09:37.28,英文,,0,0,0,,a brute force attack digitally is just someone trying, manually, all possible codes, or maybe robotically trying all possible codes, but generally automating the process in some way to go through all possibilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.28,0:09:51.37,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, if you've got, for instance, A four-digit passcode, let's ask maybe a follow-up question here, not how long it will take, but how many possible four-digit passcodes are there?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.37,0:09:53.33,英文,,0,0,0,,Because then maybe we can do some quick math.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.33,0:10:04.32,英文,,0,0,0,,And if every passcode takes me a second or a few milliseconds or the like, then I think we can try to extrapolate from that whether the first answer was seconds or minutes or days or hours or something else.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.32,0:10:06.84,英文,,0,0,0,,How many four-digit passcodes are possible?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.84,0:10:10.05,英文,,0,0,0,,If you take out your same device, it should have just changed automatically.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.05,0:10:13.93,英文,,0,0,0,,If it doesn't seem to have, maybe reload your browser with some menu option.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.93,0:10:15.05,英文,,0,0,0,,And then tap in here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.05,0:10:17.61,英文,,0,0,0,,How many four-digit passcodes are possible?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.61,0:10:24.82,英文,,0,0,0,,4 total, 40, 9,999, 10,000, or unsure is OK, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.82,0:10:27.86,英文,,0,0,0,,So let's see. We'll give you a few more moments.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.86,0:10:30.70,英文,,0,0,0,,How many four-digit passcodes are possible?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.70,0:10:33.26,英文,,0,0,0,,And shall we reveal the results?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.26,0:10:42.51,英文,,0,0,0,,So now it looks like a few of you, 2% of you, are saying just four passcodes, 40, 9,999.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.51,0:10:46.11,英文,,0,0,0,,There's definitely some contention here, and 6% are unsure.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.11,0:10:48.71,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, how do we wrap our minds around this?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.71,0:10:50.81,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, let's just kind of do this real simply here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.81,0:10:57.56,英文,,0,0,0,,Let me switch back over to doing a bit of math, and if we have here 10 possibilities for each digit.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.56,0:11:01.10,英文,,0,0,0,,If there's four digits, each digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.10,0:11:02.65,英文,,0,0,0,,So that's 10 possibilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.65,0:11:11.33,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you think about the number of permutations, that's 10 possibilities for the first digit, times 10 for the next, times 10 for the next, times 10 for the next.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.33,0:11:20.38,英文,,0,0,0,,And so if we do that out, 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, or 10 to the fourth, there are indeed, as 66% of you found, 10,000 possibilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.38,0:11:25.93,英文,,0,0,0,,So now we can kind of work backwards and decide, how long is it going to take for an adversary to hack into this phone?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.93,0:11:31.63,英文,,0,0,0,,Because if it's one attack, one guess per second, well, that's going to map out to 10,000 seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.63,0:11:34.56,英文,,0,0,0,,But maybe not if the adversary isn't a roboticist or a human.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.56,0:11:41.74,英文,,0,0,0,,What if they're, like, a software programmer, someone who's taken even a class introductory like CS50 and learned a little bit of programming?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.74,0:11:44.83,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, a little bit frighteningly, it's not all that hard to,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.83,0:11:50.05,英文,,0,0,0,,Hack into systems if you just know how to code, too, and really have the computer do your work for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.05,0:11:53.95,英文,,0,0,0,,So in fact, let me go ahead and change over to another screen on my computer here.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.95,0:11:56.42,英文,,0,0,0,,This is different for students in the group from VS Code.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.42,0:11:59.82,英文,,0,0,0,,This is just a black and white version of it that we've used briefly in the past.

Dialogue: 0,0:22:59.30,0:23:05.80,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, has anyone, and I'll zoom in on this here, accidentally locked themselves out of their own phone before?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:05.80,0:23:09.59,英文,,0,0,0,,Like, when does that happen? Yeah, when you try the password.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:09.59,0:23:10.91,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so too many times.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:10.91,0:23:12.70,英文,,0,0,0,,Maybe your finger is slightly off.

Dialogue: 0,0:23:13.94,0:23:18.78,英文,,0,0,0,,And you just don't input the same passcode correctly after, like, five times, 10 times.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:18.78,0:23:20.36,英文,,0,0,0,,There's some reasonable threshold.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:20.36,0:23:21.64,英文,,0,0,0,,And why does that happen?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:21.64,0:23:30.16,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, Apple and Google equivalently figure, just probabilistically, if after 10 guesses you still haven't typed in the right passcode, probably you're not you.

Dialogue: 0,0:23:33.79,0:23:35.19,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, what's the effect of this?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:35.19,0:23:40.05,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, this means now that each of those possible passcodes no longer takes roughly one second.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:40.05,0:23:41.79,英文,,0,0,0,,Now it takes roughly one minute.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:41.79,0:23:43.41,英文,,0,0,0,,So the attack is still the same.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:43.41,0:23:50.87,英文,,0,0,0,,But if it's now one passcode or 10 guesses per minute, we have significantly, by a factor of 60 in this story, slowed things down.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:50.87,0:23:56.34,英文,,0,0,0,,And unfortunately, does anyone know what happens if you screw up again after a minute?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:56.34,0:23:59.10,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, it goes longer. It's like five minutes, and then 10 minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:59.10,0:24:01.42,英文,,0,0,0,,And Google is kind of obnoxious about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:01.42,0:24:03.14,英文,,0,0,0,,They don't even give you a time frame.

Dialogue: 0,0:24:09.45,0:24:11.05,英文,,0,0,0,,So therein lies that trade-off.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:11.05,0:24:18.57,英文,,0,0,0,,If you've forgotten your code, if nowadays your finger is slightly wet so the screen isn't responding correctly, these could be usability downsides too.

Dialogue: 0,0:24:24.40,0:24:25.84,英文,,0,0,0,,But there's other mechanisms, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:25.84,0:24:30.66,英文,,0,0,0,,And some of you might recognize this screen from Gmail, via which, of course, you log in.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:30.66,0:24:42.34,英文,,0,0,0,,But after you log into Gmail or similar websites or apps or systems at work nowadays especially, you might be presented with what's called two-factor authentication.

Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.32,0:24:57.16,英文,,0,0,0,,Exactly, you get texted at your phone an additional code that's not your same password.

Dialogue: 0,0:25:01.57,0:25:03.17,英文,,0,0,0,,But why is this a good thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.17,0:25:08.89,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, one, it's no longer just a piece of information that you know or that you might have written down.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:08.89,0:25:12.29,英文,,0,0,0,,It's information that changes every time you try to log in.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:12.29,0:25:16.81,英文,,0,0,0,,But more importantly, it's a fundamentally second factor, which means it's not just something you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:16.81,0:25:19.35,英文,,0,0,0,,Now it's something you have, so you, for instance,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:19.35,0:25:22.32,英文,,0,0,0,,are the only one, theoretically, that should be receiving that code.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:22.32,0:25:32.86,英文,,0,0,0,,And so now the adversary, if they want to get into your account, not only have to guess or brute force or maybe read off of a Post-it note your password, they also have to physically have access now to that phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:32.86,0:25:34.73,英文,,0,0,0,,So there's still a threat, absolutely.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:34.73,0:25:39.89,英文,,0,0,0,,But it's not everyone on the internet with an internet connection Now it's only the people in Starbucks.

Dialogue: 0,0:25:45.29,0:25:52.49,英文,,0,0,0,,So there, too, it just raises the bar to the adversary, making it harder, more time-consuming, more geographically impossible for them to attack you.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:52.49,0:25:54.85,英文,,0,0,0,,But what's the downside of two-factor authentication?
Dialogue: 0,0:25:54.85,0:26:01.43,英文,,0,0,0,,Whether it's a device, or even nowadays, it's in software, whether it's on your keychain or on your phone, where you're prompted for this code.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:01.43,0:26:07.33,英文,,0,0,0,,What's a downside, as some of us have probably experienced, too?

Dialogue: 0,0:26:09.21,0:26:15.74,英文,,0,0,0,,The factor that you have, you don't have with you, or maybe you're in a basement somewhere, don't have reception, you're on a plane, you can't get the code.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:15.74,0:26:17.84,英文,,0,0,0,,And so there, too, are these trade-offs.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:17.84,0:26:21.58,英文,,0,0,0,,And even IT departments need to keep that in mind, because what does that mean for them?
Dialogue: 0,0:26:21.58,0:26:29.63,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, if you don't have your phone with you, and you are in the habit of calling IT to help you fix this, now there's a cost, a human cost, maybe even a financial cost.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:29.63,0:26:39.01,英文,,0,0,0,,And so IT policy nowadays is really just about finding the right balance and where we want to spend our resources, but at least raise the bar to the adversary.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:39.01,0:26:41.51,英文,,0,0,0,,But of course, there's other ways, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:41.51,0:26:44.94,英文,,0,0,0,,And this is going to be one of our homework assignments, if you will, after today.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:44.94,0:26:46.90,英文,,0,0,0,,There's this software called Password Managers.

Dialogue: 0,0:26:53.26,0:26:57.43,英文,,0,0,0,,Manager, OK, let me ballpark this at 10%, 20% perhaps.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:57.43,0:27:00.97,英文,,0,0,0,,OK, so we've got 80% upside here and a lesson learned potentially.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:00.97,0:27:07.47,英文,,0,0,0,,So a password manager is just a piece of software on your Mac, your PC, or your phone nowadays that manages your passwords.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.47,0:27:08.52,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, what does that mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:27:08.52,0:27:13.62,英文,,0,0,0,,When you go to a website for the first time or you download an app for the first time and you have to create an account,

Dialogue: 0,0:27:18.22,0:27:20.41,英文,,0,0,0,,So you don't have to change that methodology.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.41,0:27:33.56,英文,,0,0,0,,But instead of typing in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as your same password for that website or app as well as for every other, now you use the Password Manager software to generate something difficult to guess for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:33.56,0:27:35.56,英文,,0,0,0,,That is, you tell the Password Manager,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:35.56,0:27:42.03,英文,,0,0,0,,Give me an eight-character random passcode, not 0, 0, 0, 0, but something with punctuation, with numbers, with letters.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:42.03,0:27:47.27,英文,,0,0,0,,And better yet, the password manager, as the name suggests, remembers that password for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:47.27,0:27:53.20,英文,,0,0,0,,And the next time you go to another website, you do it again with a completely different password, maybe same username, maybe two-factor authentication.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:53.20,0:27:56.12,英文,,0,0,0,,But different password, different password, different password.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:56.12,0:27:57.16,英文,,0,0,0,,And it doesn't have to be eight.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:57.16,0:28:01.39,英文,,0,0,0,,I mean, I'm in the habit of using a dozen, two dozen characters in total.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:01.39,0:28:07.63,英文,,0,0,0,,And at that point, I can't even pronounce the number of possibilities because it goes well beyond the quadrillion.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:07.63,0:28:13.14,英文,,0,0,0,,So the probability that someone's going to get into one of those accounts for me now is very, very, very low.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:13.14,0:28:18.80,英文,,0,0,0,,And they're going to take less interest in me and maybe more interest in someone else that's not using as good of a password.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:18.80,0:28:20.42,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, what does this mean in real terms?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:20.42,0:28:26.39,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, when you go to log into that managed site, you don't manually type your password anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:26.39,0:28:28.39,英文,,0,0,0,,In fact, you don't generally even need to know it.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:28.39,0:28:32.95,英文,,0,0,0,,Nowadays, I probably don't know 90-plus, 99% of my passwords.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:32.95,0:28:35.35,英文,,0,0,0,,I entrust them to this password manager.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:35.35,0:28:40.38,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, of course, you'd like to think that the password manager itself is secure.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:40.38,0:28:41.50,英文,,0,0,0,,So what might that mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.50,0:28:46.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, those of you who do use a password manager, how do you access that software itself?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:46.76,0:28:48.61,英文,,0,0,0,,What's protecting your data?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:48.61,0:28:50.63,英文,,0,0,0,,In your understanding.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.63,0:28:56.69,英文,,0,0,0,,So maybe biometrics, like your face ID, or maybe your fingerprint, or maybe more simply, what else?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:56.69,0:28:57.95,英文,,0,0,0,,Maybe just a password.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:57.95,0:29:05.21,英文,,0,0,0,,And hopefully, that password, that primary password, that gatekeeper, is not itself 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Dialogue: 0,0:29:08.65,0:29:12.46,英文,,0,0,0,,But if you're willing to put in the effort and pick one pretty long,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:12.46,0:29:17.18,英文,,0,0,0,,Somewhat random, very unguessable password that you just promise to commit to memory.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:17.18,0:29:26.66,英文,,0,0,0,,And maybe for backup, you literally print it out and put it in a safe deposit box or a safe or just kind of hide it somewhere physically that there's very low probability someone's going to find the backup copy.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:26.66,0:29:27.70,英文,,0,0,0,,That might be a loan.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:27.70,0:29:34.73,英文,,0,0,0,,But of course, the flip side is now, if you forget that primary password, you've now lost all of the eggs in the basket.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:34.73,0:29:38.97,英文,,0,0,0,,If someone gets that primary password, now they have access to everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:38.97,0:29:40.37,英文,,0,0,0,,So that's rather the trade-off.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:40.37,0:29:52.72,英文,,0,0,0,,But I dare say you're probably less threatened, depending on your family, by the people immediately around you than the billions of other people on the internet that have access, potentially, to those same systems.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:52.72,0:29:53.94,英文,,0,0,0,,So there, too, it's a trade-off.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:53.94,0:29:57.88,英文,,0,0,0,,And it's up to you to decide whether or not to manage your passwords in this way.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:57.88,0:30:06.48,英文,,0,0,0,,But if you were on that top 10 list, or even if you're not, but you can think of several accounts that all have the same password, you're probably going to benefit from something like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:06.48,0:30:15.95,英文,,0,0,0,,And why is it bad, to be clear, to use the same password on multiple sites, in case that's never sort of dawned in thought?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:15.95,0:30:20.57,英文,,0,0,0,,Why is that a bad thing, to reuse a password on different websites, different apps?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:20.57,0:30:25.07,英文,,0,0,0,,Any intuition? Yeah, in back?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:25.07,0:30:38.56,英文,,0,0,0,,Exactly, once it's attacked, the adversary, presumably by transitivity, can see, oh, well, if this user's username is malan at harvard.edu on this website, and their password is foolishly 123456, or even something way more complicated,

Dialogue: 0,0:30:52.58,0:30:55.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So what's maybe a takeaway minimally here?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:55.21,0:30:57.89,英文,,0,0,0,,I would start to reconsider your passcodes on your most important data.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:57.89,0:31:04.15,英文,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's medical. Maybe it's financial. Maybe it's email. Anything remotely personal that you really wouldn't want to have access.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:04.15,0:31:07.55,英文,,0,0,0,,Do you necessarily need the same level of security on e-commerce?

Dialogue: 0,0:31:13.84,0:31:15.46,英文,,0,0,0,,So you can decide for yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:15.46,0:31:22.08,英文,,0,0,0,,But again, software, like a password manager, and these are just some of the possibilities out there, are probably to be your friend.

Dialogue: 0,0:31:35.09,0:31:36.53,英文,,0,0,0,,So most of us nowadays.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:36.53,0:31:41.30,英文,,0,0,0,,have probably heard of encryption, this technique for just kind of scrambling information.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.30,0:31:50.94,英文,,0,0,0,,So when you want to send a message, an email, or upload a photograph, or use your credit card, hopefully it's not just being sent out for all to see, but there's some kind of scrambling going on.

Dialogue: 0,0:32:03.39,0:32:09.66,英文,,0,0,0,,So encryption is sort of commonplace nowadays, both in websites and apps and ATMs and other such devices.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:09.66,0:32:10.42,英文,,0,0,0,,But how does it work?
Dialogue: 0,0:32:10.42,0:32:16.66,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, back in week two of CS50, your child learned a little something about encryption, otherwise known as cryptography.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:16.66,0:32:21.31,英文,,0,0,0,,And one of the algorithms we talked about was quite simply something like this.

This might slow things down potentially, but it is a feature increasingly that's offered, and it's absolutely something you should consider enabling in general, especially if your laptop or phone travels with you, and certainly your phone does.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.93,0:01:48.39,中文,,0,0,0,,所以屏幕上有很多 0 和 1。
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.39,0:01:54.33,中文,,0,0,0,,简单来说，让我用一句话概括过去九周的内容，这就是底层发生的事情。
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.33,0:01:58.95,中文,,0,0,0,,当然，今天，我们想让事情更容易理解，更广泛地应用。
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.95,0:02:04.25,中文,,0,0,0,,事实上，我们今天的重点将不是这些 0 和 1 的模式代表什么。
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.25,0:02:10.10,中文,,0,0,0,,敏锐的眼睛可能会注意到，这些灯泡以亮和灭的模式在视觉上复制了这些内容。
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.10,0:02:17.50,中文,,0,0,0,,正如你的孩子在上课前或现在可能暗示的那样，这很可能拼出一个最多八个字符的单词。
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.50,0:02:27.33,中文,,0,0,0,,因为即使在现实世界中，你也可以对事物进行数字编码。但今天，我们将专注于更高级别的东西，即网络安全这个概念，比如我们数据的安全，
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.33,0:02:36.74,中文,,0,0,0,,我们系统的隐私，尤其是在当今的互联网上，因为我们每个人大概都在口袋里装着各种技术设备，每天都在使用笔记本电脑和台式机。
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.74,0:02:47.15,中文,,0,0,0,,所以今天我们的目标不是规定引擎盖下面正在发生的事情，而是让我们在更高的层次上解决一些问题，这样当你回到你所访问的地方时，
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.15,0:03:00.15,中文,,0,0,0,,你的家庭作业实际上就可以应用今天学到的课程。\N 因此，话虽如此，也许最常见的保护个人系统和数据的防御手段，比如手机、笔记本电脑和台式机，就是这些简单的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.15,0:03:05.03,中文,,0,0,0,,不幸的是，坦率地说，你和我都不是那么擅长选择密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.03,0:03:19.78,中文,,0,0,0,,这本身就是一种相对薄弱的防御形式，即使我们每个人现在都有几十个、几百个密码，或者至少是几十个或几百个账户，也许是五六十个密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.78,0:03:25.07,中文,,0,0,0,,事实上，如果你有重复使用密码的习惯，我们今天可能会从我们的第一个教训中学到。
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.07,0:03:39.29,中文,,0,0,0,,例如，如果我们回顾过去的一年，2021 年，多亏了安全研究人员查看了通过公共数据库在线泄露或被黑客入侵的数据，作为计算机科学家，
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.29,0:03:44.17,中文,,0,0,0,,我们了解到最流行的或者等价地，看看你我都为系统选择的那些最糟糕的密码是什么。
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.17,0:03:53.53,中文,,0,0,0,,根据一项指标，截至去年，各地系统中最常用的密码是 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6。
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.53,0:04:00.93,中文,,0,0,0,,好吧，我们前十名中的第二名密码只是稍微长一点，1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.93,0:04:05.89,中文,,0,0,0,,在那之后，我们转向了另一个方向，仅仅是 1, 2, 3, 4, 5。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.89,0:04:15.92,中文,,0,0,0,,在那之后，变得更有趣了一些，QWERTY，这听起来可能很神秘，但如果你低头看看你的美式键盘，它就是美式键盘上左上角的那排键。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.92,0:04:18.38,中文,,0,0,0,,也不难猜到。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.38,0:04:25.40,中文,,0,0,0,,也许并不奇怪，但有点令人不安的是，第五名是 Password。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.40,0:04:29.30,中文,,0,0,0,,同时，第六名又回到了数字。1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.30,0:04:33.43,中文,,0,0,0,,在那之后，真的更不用费力了。1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.43,0:04:37.85,中文,,0,0,0,,在那之后，稍微多了一点变化，但也没有那么多。1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.85,0:04:42.05,中文,,0,0,0,,在那之后，它变得越来越没意思了。1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.05,0:04:45.51,中文,,0,0,0,,最后，排在榜首的是 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.51,0:04:48.37,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这不是一个你想上的“十大”榜单。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.37,0:04:54.50,中文,,0,0,0,,所以今天的第一条重要信息是，如果你在这个屏幕上看到了你的密码，那么你上榜的方式可不怎么样。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.50,0:04:59.40,中文,,0,0,0,,这意味着可能有成百上千，甚至数百万人都在使用你的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.40,0:05:05.90,中文,,0,0,0,,现在，就其本身而言，这并不一定令人担忧，因为我不知道在这个房间里谁有这些密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.90,0:05:09.62,中文,,0,0,0,,但凭直觉，为什么这是件坏事？
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.62,0:05:14.19,中文,,0,0,0,,家长或孩子，欢迎举手示意。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.19,0:05:16.33,中文,,0,0,0,,为什么会这样呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.33,0:05:18.91,中文,,0,0,0,,凭直觉，是的。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.91,0:05:19.94,中文,,0,0,0,,可以访问它。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.94,0:05:24.74,中文,,0,0,0,,作为计算机科学家，我们确实拥有一个包含常见密码的数据库。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.74,0:05:28.97,中文,,0,0,0,,你有什么想法？
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.97,0:05:30.71,中文,,0,0,0,,可以快速找到它。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.71,0:05:36.43,中文,,0,0,0,,你可以想象一下，尝试随机输入字母、数字和单词来猜别人的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.43,0:05:42.06,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果你有排名前十的列表，情况就不同了，世界上的攻击者们很可能就是从这份列表开始的。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.06,0:05:44.92,中文,,0,0,0,,你会注意到，即使在这份列表中也没有细微的变体。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.92,0:05:51.28,中文,,0,0,0,,有些人可能会想，我使用感叹号代替数字1，我的密码不在列表中。
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:06:00.01,中文,,0,0,0,,或者用3代替E，用5代替S。从现在房间里大家的笑容来看，你们并没有那么聪明，因为其他人也在笑，
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.01,0:06:09.01,中文,,0,0,0,,这意味着攻击者可以使用相同的策略，通过将某些字母调整为数字，反之亦然，你可能认为这样做会让密码更安全。
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.01,0:06:14.08,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果你这样做，其他人也这样做，那么所谓的坏人也会这样做。
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.08,0:06:21.52,中文,,0,0,0,,不幸的是，说到密码，越长、越随机、越难猜越好，但这并不是我们大多数人的做法。
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.52,0:06:30.06,中文,,0,0,0,,事实上，举个例子，在我们的手机上，无论你是用Android设备还是iPhone，如果你设置了密码保护，那很可能是一个相对简单的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.06,0:06:34.79,中文,,0,0,0,,但至少苹果和谷歌现在很擅长引导我们选择这类密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.79,0:06:38.45,中文,,0,0,0,,四位数密码现在很常见。
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.45,0:06:57.58,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，我们可以利用之前屏幕上显示的URL，作为一个小组来推测，攻击者需要多长时间才能破解你的四位数手机密码？
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.58,0:07:01.60,中文,,0,0,0,,这位是CS50的Carter。Carter，我们可以切换画面并对观众进行投票。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.60,0:07:11.16,中文,,0,0,0,,请拿出你的手机或笔记本电脑，用你几分钟前扫描二维码或访问相同URL的设备。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.16,0:07:14.30,中文,,0,0,0,,你可以在浏览器上看到这些问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.30,0:07:15.96,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你看不到，也没关系。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.96,0:07:18.38,中文,,0,0,0,,我们会分享一些汇总数据。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.38,0:07:20.80,中文,,0,0,0,,你可以选择你认为对的答案。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.80,0:07:27.20,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你想一起参与，我们会给大家多几秒钟的时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.20,0:07:30.81,中文,,0,0,0,,稍等片刻。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.81,0:07:34.87,中文,,0,0,0,,可能很多人都在回答，我们不妨来看看比例。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.87,0:07:39.34,中文,,0,0,0,,看起来大多数人，67% 的人认为是几秒钟。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.34,0:07:42.50,中文,,0,0,0,,如果是一个四位数的密码，这可不是什么好消息。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.50,0:07:45.12,中文,,0,0,0,,有些人希望是几分钟。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.12,0:07:50.71,中文,,0,0,0,,8% 的人希望是几个小时。超过 4% 的人真的希望可能是几天。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.71,0:07:58.50,中文,,0,0,0,,让我们实际考虑一下如何回答这个问题，并使今天不仅是概念性的，而且还有一点量化的内容，看看我们是否可以对这类问题进行一些数字上的量化。
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.50,0:08:01.76,中文,,0,0,0,,这样，你就可以在你的系统安全方面做出更明智的决定。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.76,0:08:10.15,中文,,0,0,0,,例如，当涉及到四位数密码时，与其只考虑它的安全性，不如把它变成一个更精确的问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.15,0:08:20.15,中文,,0,0,0,,比如，攻击的形式有哪些？最简单的攻击方式可能是有人拿着你的手机，\N 无论是在你的家里，还是在星巴克、机场或类似的地方，然后开始尝试所有可能的组合。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.15,0:08:26.57,中文,,0,0,0,,也许是 0, 0, 0, 0，然后是 0, 0, 0, 1，然后是 0, 0, 0, 2。也许我们可以把这个过程自动化一点。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.57,0:08:32.60,中文,,0,0,0,,例如，我可能可以用机器人来完成这个任务。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.60,0:08:35.22,中文,,0,0,0,,让我全屏播放一段视频。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.22,0:08:44.16,中文,,0,0,0,,这将在一瞬间在屏幕上描绘出一幅画面，如果我们是一个非常聪明的对手，并且知道如何构建东西，至少我们可以将其中一些过程自动化。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.16,0:08:46.56,中文,,0,0,0,,这是一部放在柜台上的安卓手机。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.56,0:08:52.27,中文,,0,0,0,,这是一个非常简单的三脚架和一个小型的触摸设备，可以自动为你完成所有黑客攻击。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.27,0:08:56.35,中文,,0,0,0,,从 0, 0, 0, 0 开始，一直到 9, 9, 9, 9。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.35,0:08:59.44,中文,,0,0,0,,然而，这也不一定就快。
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.44,0:09:08.37,中文,,0,0,0,,但至少攻击者可以抽身离开，不必为实际入侵特定设备所需的时间和成本而烦恼。
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.37,0:09:14.31,中文,,0,0,0,,我们来深入探讨一下，考虑一个更有趣的问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.31,0:09:20.13,中文,,0,0,0,,这种所谓的暴力攻击到底需要多少时间？这实际上是一个专业术语。
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.13,0:09:29.28,中文,,0,0,0,,就像过去，有人可能用攻城锤试图强行攻入城堡，数字世界的暴力攻击就是有人手动尝试所有可能的密码，
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.28,0:09:37.28,中文,,0,0,0,,或者用机器人尝试所有可能的密码，但通常会以某种方式自动化这个过程，遍历所有可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.28,0:09:51.37,中文,,0,0,0,,假设你有一个四位数的密码，我们先不问需要多长时间，而是问有多少种可能的四位数密码？
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.37,0:09:53.33,中文,,0,0,0,,因为也许我们可以快速计算一下。
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.33,0:10:04.32,中文,,0,0,0,,如果每个密码需要我花费一秒或几毫秒，那么我认为我们可以由此推断出第一个答案是几秒、几分钟、几天、几小时还是其他什么。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.32,0:10:06.84,中文,,0,0,0,,四位数密码有多少种可能？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.84,0:10:10.05,中文,,0,0,0,,拿出你的设备，它应该已经自动更新了。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.05,0:10:13.93,中文,,0,0,0,,如果看起来没有更新，也许可以用菜单选项刷新浏览器。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.93,0:10:15.05,中文,,0,0,0,,然后点击这里。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.05,0:10:17.61,中文,,0,0,0,,四位数密码有多少种可能？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.61,0:10:24.82,中文,,0,0,0,,总共 4 个，40 个，9,999 个，10,000 个，或者不确定也可以。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.82,0:10:27.86,中文,,0,0,0,,我们再给大家一些时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.86,0:10:30.70,中文,,0,0,0,,四位数密码有多少种可能？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.70,0:10:33.26,中文,,0,0,0,,我们来揭晓答案吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.26,0:10:42.51,中文,,0,0,0,,现在看来，你们中的一些人，2% 的人说是只有 4 个密码，40 个，9,999 个。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.51,0:10:46.11,中文,,0,0,0,,这里肯定存在一些争议，6% 的人不确定。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.11,0:10:48.71,中文,,0,0,0,,我们该如何理解这个问题？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.71,0:10:50.81,中文,,0,0,0,,我们来简单地分析一下。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.81,0:10:57.56,中文,,0,0,0,,我们回到数学上来，如果每一位数字都有 10 种可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.56,0:11:01.10,中文,,0,0,0,,如果总共是四位数，那每一位可以是 0、1、2、3、4、5、6、7、8、9。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.10,0:11:02.65,中文,,0,0,0,,也就是 10 种可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.65,0:11:11.33,中文,,0,0,0,,所以如果你想想排列组合的数量，第一位是 10 种可能性，乘以第二位的 10 种，再乘以第三位的 10 种，再乘以第四位的 10 种。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.33,0:11:20.38,中文,,0,0,0,,所以如果我们计算一下，10 乘以 10 乘以 10 乘以 10，或者说 10 的四次方，就像你们 66% 的人发现的那样，确实有 10,000 种可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.38,0:11:25.93,中文,,0,0,0,,现在我们可以反过来思考，攻击者需要多长时间才能破解这部手机？
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.93,0:11:31.63,中文,,0,0,0,,因为如果每秒钟尝试一次，那就需要 10,000 秒。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.63,0:11:34.56,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果攻击者不是机器人或人类，情况可能就不是这样了。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.56,0:11:41.74,中文,,0,0,0,,如果他们是一个软件程序员，一个上过 CS50 之类的入门课程、学过一点编程的人呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.74,0:11:44.83,中文,,0,0,0,,有点可怕的是，这并不难，
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.83,0:11:50.05,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你知道如何编写代码，并且能让计算机帮你完成工作，那么入侵系统并不难。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.05,0:11:53.95,中文,,0,0,0,,让我切换到我电脑上的另一个屏幕。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.95,0:11:56.42,中文,,0,0,0,,这对 VS Code 组的学生来说是不一样的。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.42,0:11:59.82,中文,,0,0,0,,这只是我们过去简要使用过的黑白版本。
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.82,0:12:04.26,中文,,0,0,0,,我将创建一个名为 crack.py 的程序来破解一些东西。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.26,0:12:08.55,中文,,0,0,0,,从技术上讲，这意味着要找出它是什么，在这种情况下就是找出密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.55,0:12:16.40,中文,,0,0,0,,.py 意味着我将使用一种编程语言，我们在 CS50 过去几周一直在学习这种语言，下周还会继续学习。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.40,0:12:20.39,中文,,0,0,0,,事实证明，你不需要理解每一行代码，
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.39,0:12:27.05,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我想尝试生成所有 10,000 个可能的密码，我就不会用机器人了。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.05,0:12:29.23,中文,,0,0,0,,我的电脑上插着这么多线。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:29.23,0:12:32.48,中文,,0,0,0,,很有可能其中一根就是 USB 数据线或者 lightning 连接线。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.48,0:12:44.36,中文,,0,0,0,,当然，我们肯定能找到办法将笔记本电脑或台式机连接到手机上，像电影或电视里那样，将所有数字自动发送到手机上，直到其中一个数字解锁成功。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.36,0:12:47.36,中文,,0,0,0,,在 Python 中，我可以编写一个程序来实现这一点。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:47.36,0:12:51.57,中文,,0,0,0,,我可以导入，也可以说是导入从 0 到 9 的所有十进制数字。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.57,0:12:57.63,中文,,0,0,0,,对于在座的学生来说，这只是比手动输入 10 个不同的数字稍微好一点的版本。
Dialogue: 0,0:12:57.63,0:13:04.82,中文,,0,0,0,,我还可以从一个库中导入，也就是叫做 itertools 的库，表示迭代工具，意思是反复做某件事。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.82,0:13:13.68,中文,,0,0,0,,我可以导入一个叫做 product 的函数，意思是叉积，就像把这个和这个组合多次一样。然后就只剩下两行代码了。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.68,0:13:15.91,中文,,0,0,0,,我可以使用编程中称为循环的东西。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.91,0:13:31.66,中文,,0,0,0,,所以对于所有 10 个数字重复四次的叉积中的每一个密码，\N 与其费心连接我的手机并破解我自己的手机，不如让我直接在屏幕上打印出这 10,000 个密码中的每一个。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.66,0:13:34.04,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我们会看看黑客能多快完成。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.04,0:13:39.78,中文,,0,0,0,,让我来打印，用星号，这是一个格式化的小技巧，我会打印出每个密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.78,0:13:40.62,中文,,0,0,0,,就是这样。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:40.62,0:13:47.41,中文,,0,0,0,,四行代码，可能说了 40 秒，但如果我真的在没有观众的情况下这样做，可能只需要 4 秒钟的编码时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:47.41,0:13:49.65,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我来保存文件。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:49.65,0:13:54.43,中文,,0,0,0,,我要运行，就像我们最近每天在课堂上做的那样，运行 Python crack.py。
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.43,0:14:00.21,中文,,0,0,0,,当我按下回车键时，我应该在屏幕上看到从 0, 0, 0, 0 到 9, 9, 9, 9 的所有 10,000 种可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.21,0:14:04.71,中文,,0,0,0,,让我们看看，是几秒、几分钟、几小时，还是？ 几天。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.71,0:14:06.03,中文,,0,0,0,,完成了。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:06.03,0:14:08.80,中文,,0,0,0,,所以连几秒钟都不到，复数形式。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.80,0:14:15.36,中文,,0,0,0,,这有点让人担忧，因为攻击者只需要从桌子上拿起你的手机，插上一根线，瞬间就能成功。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:15.36,0:14:20.81,中文,,0,0,0,,不像电影或电视里那样，你需要担心时间不够用，或者你会突然走进房间。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.81,0:14:23.39,中文,,0,0,0,,你不需要那么长的破解时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.39,0:14:24.89,中文,,0,0,0,,有什么比这更好的方法吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:14:24.89,0:14:30.41,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们不想只使用四位数的密码，可以考虑哪些选择呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.41,0:14:32.99,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上，你们中的一些人可能设置了比这更好的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.99,0:14:35.63,中文,,0,0,0,,也许你使用的是四位字母的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.63,0:14:38.80,中文,,0,0,0,,比如 A 到 Z，也许还区分大小写。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.80,0:14:41.18,中文,,0,0,0,,这就开始变得有趣了。
Dialogue: 0,0:14:41.18,0:14:43.08,中文,,0,0,0,,那我们也来算算这个吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.08,0:14:57.92,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们把四位数字密码升级为四位字母密码，也就是 A 到 Z 的英文字母，区分大小写，那么总共有多少种可能的四位字母密码呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.92,0:15:00.60,中文,,0,0,0,,这一次，范围从 4 开始。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.60,0:15:03.30,中文,,0,0,0,,不过，这次的答案仍然不正确。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:03.30,0:15:11.05,中文,,0,0,0,,有多少种可能的四位字母密码？
Dialogue: 0,0:15:11.05,0:15:16.56,中文,,0,0,0,,再给大家一些时间思考。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.56,0:15:18.08,中文,,0,0,0,,好了。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.08,0:15:20.14,中文,,0,0,0,,已经收到近 200 个答案了。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.14,0:15:25.38,中文,,0,0,0,,再给大家几秒钟。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:25.38,0:15:33.85,中文,,0,0,0,,然后… 让我们揭晓答案，我们至少解决了一些问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.85,0:15:37.50,中文,,0,0,0,,有人在耍我们。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:37.50,0:15:43.26,中文,,0,0,0,,看起来你们大部分人，76% 的人认为是 700 万种可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:43.26,0:15:47.12,中文,,0,0,0,,这很令人鼓舞，因为这比以前多了一个数量级。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.12,0:15:49.26,中文,,0,0,0,,我们来看看如何用数学方法计算。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.26,0:15:55.09,中文,,0,0,0,,我们有 26 个小写字母，26 个大写字母，这四位数字每个都有 52 种可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:15:55.09,0:16:05.82,中文,,0,0,0,,也就是 52 乘以自身四次，不管你是心算、估算还是用计算器，结果确实是 700 万。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:05.82,0:16:08.26,中文,,0,0,0,,还有什么可能比这更好？
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.26,0:16:09.82,中文,,0,0,0,,也许是四个字符。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.82,0:16:13.42,中文,,0,0,0,,这确实是现在的 Mac、PC 和手机都在敦促我们做的事情。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.42,0:16:17.48,中文,,0,0,0,,不仅是数字，不仅是字母，还有烦人的标点符号。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:17.48,0:16:22.03,中文,,0,0,0,,所以它看起来很神秘，不仅对对手来说，对我们来说也很难懂。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:22.03,0:16:23.05,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是缺点。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.05,0:16:29.73,中文,,0,0,0,,但现在，我们有了一个思维模型和计算框架来评估它们的安全性。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:29.73,0:16:37.02,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们有 52 个字母，包括大小写，10 个数字，我先把其中的一些数学知识剧透一下。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.02,0:16:42.42,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我在键盘上数一下，典型的英语语法中大约有 32 个标点符号。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.42,0:16:49.31,中文,,0,0,0,,这实际上给了我们 94 种可能性，高于 52，也高于 10。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.31,0:16:50.77,中文,,0,0,0,,现在我们真的在进步了。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.77,0:16:55.45,中文,,0,0,0,,现在这就给了我们 7800 万种可能性，又是一个数量级。
Dialogue: 0,0:16:55.45,0:16:58.28,中文,,0,0,0,,现在，它仍然会相对较快，因为你知道吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.28,0:17:01.32,中文,,0,0,0,,我实际上可以做到这一点，让我回到我的代码中。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:01.32,0:17:06.86,中文,,0,0,0,,让我重新打开同一个程序，我可以指出进行这些更改是多么容易。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:06.86,0:17:14.85,中文,,0,0,0,,我可以导入 ASCII 字符（而不是像以前那样导入数字），如你的孩子可能知道的那样，ASCII 字符是大写和小写的 A 到 Z。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:14.85,0:17:16.99,中文,,0,0,0,,我可以在这里更改。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.99,0:17:18.51,中文,,0,0,0,,ASCII 字符。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.51,0:17:21.33,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是我们更改为字母的第一个版本。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:21.33,0:17:22.77,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我重新运行代码。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.77,0:17:26.14,中文,,0,0,0,,我们将看到字母飞过屏幕，而不是数字。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.14,0:17:33.18,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我走到屏幕这边，我们会看到，当我走到这里时，我们已经完成了一半的小写字母表。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:33.18,0:17:37.73,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我现在开始走开，我想，是的，我们现在已经完成了大写字母。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:37.73,0:17:47.91,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我进一步升级它，让我们更进一步，也许可以这样做，比如 ASCII 字母、数字和标点符号。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:47.91,0:17:50.56,中文,,0,0,0,,这是 Pythonic 的表达方式。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.56,0:17:55.96,中文,,0,0,0,,我要将那些相同的数字、相同的标点符号添加到这些字母中。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:55.96,0:17:58.89,中文,,0,0,0,,让我缩小我的字体，以便代码仍然适合屏幕。
Dialogue: 0,0:17:58.89,0:18:06.28,中文,,0,0,0,,现在我们得到的是，经过两秒钟的更改，如果我运行此版本，程序就会出现问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:06.28,0:18:10.72,中文,,0,0,0,,没有排版错误，这就是我们在 CS50 中所说的错误。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:10.72,0:18:12.78,中文,,0,0,0,,现在我们运行相同的。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.78,0:18:17.04,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是我们在 CS50 中所说的第二个错误。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:17.04,0:18:19.62,中文,,0,0,0,,标点符号。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.62,0:18:20.54,中文,,0,0,0,,好的。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.54,0:18:21.84,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是我祈祷的地方。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:21.84,0:18:22.36,中文,,0,0,0,,好的。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:22.36,0:18:29.25,中文,,0,0,0,,现在屏幕上滚动太快，可能有点看不清了，但你应该已经瞥见了一些奇怪的标点符号。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:29.25,0:18:33.45,中文,,0,0,0,,我就不浪费时间解释这个了，因为这需要很长时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:33.45,0:18:34.67,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还在小写字母阶段。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:34.67,0:18:36.01,中文,,0,0,0,,我这里还没到 n 呢。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:36.01,0:18:40.89,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还没到 n，然后是 o，然后是 p。所以这还需要一段时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:40.89,0:18:44.61,中文,,0,0,0,,但最后让我们以一个关于所有这些系统安全性的问题来结束。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:44.61,0:18:47.71,中文,,0,0,0,,我要按键盘上的 Control-C 来取消。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:47.71,0:18:49.81,中文,,0,0,0,,让我们换个问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:49.81,0:18:55.78,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们使用八位数密码，也就是两倍于之前的字符数，但这也不算太长，对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:18:55.78,0:18:57.94,中文,,0,0,0,,这只是八个字符。
Dialogue: 0,0:18:57.94,0:19:01.08,中文,,0,0,0,,使用字母、数字和标点符号的八个字符可能会更好。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:01.08,0:19:03.68,中文,,0,0,0,,我们来做最后一次投票。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:03.68,0:19:12.97,中文,,0,0,0,,在相同的设备上，现在这些八位数密码有多少种可能性？
Dialogue: 0,0:19:12.97,0:19:17.04,中文,,0,0,0,,现在发送答案，这次还要列出来。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.04,0:19:21.68,中文,,0,0,0,,再过几秒钟，目前为止大约有 100 个回复。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:21.68,0:19:26.38,中文,,0,0,0,,Carter，如果你不介意的话，我们继续公布投票结果吧。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.38,0:19:32.26,中文,,0,0,0,,结果分布相当不错，不过 quadrillion 很快就冲上来了，正在和其他选项竞争。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.26,0:19:35.70,中文,,0,0,0,,看来 44% 的人选择了 quintillion。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.70,0:19:36.78,中文,,0,0,0,,34% 的人选择了 quadrillion。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:36.78,0:19:39.92,中文,,0,0,0,,这次你第一次出价过高了。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:39.92,0:19:44.27,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们回头看这里的数学计算，至少大多数人都出价过高。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.27,0:19:50.57,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们有 8 个字符的密码，那就是 94 乘以自身 8 次，或者说是 94 的 8 次方。
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.57,0:20:02.63,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上，这大约是 6 quadrillion 95 trillion 689 billion 385 million 410,000 零 816 种可能的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.63,0:20:04.09,中文,,0,0,0,,这意味着什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.09,0:20:10.73,中文,,0,0,0,,攻击者的算法，也就是他们为入侵你的手机而编写的代码，没什么两样。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.73,0:20:16.82,中文,,0,0,0,,说实话，如果你的密码有 8 个字符长，但它们是 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:16.82,0:20:18.48,中文,,0,0,0,,你的安全程度从根本上来说并没有提高。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.48,0:20:30.30,中文,,0,0,0,,你真正想要的是在那个庞大值域中的某个最佳位置，这样，如果攻击者尝试这种暴力攻击，仅仅是遍历所有可能性，他们最终会找到你的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:30.30,0:20:32.56,中文,,0,0,0,,从数学上讲，它就在那里。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:32.56,0:20:39.80,中文,,0,0,0,,但愿，也许不是但愿，你、我和他们都将离开这个世界，因为已经过去了那么长时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.80,0:20:49.23,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们计算一下，这个秒数，例如，已经远远超过了我们不复存在的时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:49.23,0:20:53.55,中文,,0,0,0,,这种衡量标准是我们没有从根本上改变攻击者的等式。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.55,0:20:54.55,中文,,0,0,0,,风险还是一样的。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:54.55,0:20:55.69,中文,,0,0,0,,攻击方式还是一样的。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:55.69,0:20:59.50,中文,,0,0,0,,但你大大降低了他们成功的可能性。
Dialogue: 0,0:20:59.50,0:21:02.88,中文,,0,0,0,,或者从概念上讲，你提高了攻击者的成本。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:02.88,0:21:06.02,中文,,0,0,0,,事实上，即使在现实世界中也是如此。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.02,0:21:10.78,中文,,0,0,0,,你只是希望你在数字世界中的密码真的比别人的好。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:10.78,0:21:14.73,中文,,0,0,0,,因为你希望攻击者对别人的密码下手。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.73,0:21:21.99,中文,,0,0,0,,就像现实世界中一样，虽然想起来有点不舒服，但你自己就是。 房子不需要100%安全。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:21.99,0:21:24.03,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上，也很难做到这一点。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:24.03,0:21:28.92,中文,,0,0,0,,总会有弱点。 可能是窗户、门或类似的东西。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:28.92,0:21:34.72,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果你的家比隔壁邻居家更安全，从概率上来说，你就更安全。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:34.72,0:21:35.86,中文,,0,0,0,,你并不安全。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:35.86,0:21:41.52,中文,,0,0,0,,事实上，你在路上看到的任何网站，如果它说“因为我们做了 x、y 或 z，所以我们很安全”，那都是胡说八道。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.52,0:21:49.82,中文,,0,0,0,,安全性实际上是比较和评估事物，如果要量化的话，是相对于其他系统、其他代码而言的。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:49.82,0:21:51.56,中文,,0,0,0,,那么，这里的要点是什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:21:51.56,0:21:58.14,中文,,0,0,0,,好吧，希望你们中不少人会在本周末或下周一回家后，至少更改一个密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:58.14,0:21:59.36,中文,,0,0,0,,但这将是一个权衡。
Dialogue: 0,0:21:59.36,0:22:01.31,中文,,0,0,0,,我们在 CS50 中一直都在讨论这个问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:01.31,0:22:07.41,中文,,0,0,0,,每当我们改进某些东西时，我们都要在时间、性能、成本等方面付出代价。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:07.41,0:22:13.87,中文,,0,0,0,,那么，使用至少八个字符的密码的建议有什么缺点呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:22:13.87,0:22:17.81,中文,,0,0,0,,你为什么可能想说不，不想这么做呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:22:17.81,0:22:20.80,中文,,0,0,0,,再说一遍？你必须记住它，对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:22:20.80,0:22:22.92,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这里面有一些社会学的东西。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:22.92,0:22:24.58,中文,,0,0,0,,有一些人类行为。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:24.58,0:22:30.49,中文,,0,0,0,,你们中的一些人可能有同事，如果你在现实世界中工作，至少在过去更健康的时期，你的同事有办公桌和隔间。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:30.49,0:22:35.47,中文,,0,0,0,,办公室里可能会有一个人，他们的显示器上贴着写有密码的便利贴。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:35.47,0:22:38.83,中文,,0,0,0,,这有点网络安全犯罪的意味。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:38.83,0:22:45.53,中文,,0,0,0,,但这也许也是公司政策没有真正根据人类行为进行调整而造成的一种现实副作用。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:45.53,0:22:47.59,中文,,0,0,0,,我们看看有没有其他防御措施。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:47.59,0:22:52.59,中文,,0,0,0,,我们来简单地讨论一个实际上往往会自动启动的防御措施。
Dialogue: 0,0:22:52.59,0:22:59.30,中文,,0,0,0,,即使你的密码不像我们刚才看到的那么强大，只有这 6 千万亿种可能性中的一种，那我们还能怎么做？
Dialogue: 0,0:22:59.30,0:23:05.80,中文,,0,0,0,,这里有人曾经不小心把自己锁在手机外面吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:23:05.80,0:23:09.59,中文,,0,0,0,,什么时候会发生这种情况？当你尝试输入密码的时候。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:09.59,0:23:10.91,中文,,0,0,0,,试了太多次。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:10.91,0:23:12.70,中文,,0,0,0,,也许你的手指稍微偏了一点。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:12.70,0:23:13.94,中文,,0,0,0,,也许你只是稍微偏了一点。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:13.94,0:23:18.78,中文,,0,0,0,,你在五次、十次之后，都没能正确输入相同的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:18.78,0:23:20.36,中文,,0,0,0,,这里有一个合理的阈值。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:20.36,0:23:21.64,中文,,0,0,0,,为什么会发生这种情况？
Dialogue: 0,0:23:21.64,0:23:30.16,中文,,0,0,0,,Apple 和 Google 都从概率上认为，如果在 10 次尝试后你仍然没有输入正确的密码，那你很可能不是你自己。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:30.16,0:23:31.88,中文,,0,0,0,,你是捡到手机的其他人。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:31.88,0:23:33.79,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们会把你锁在外面。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:33.79,0:23:35.19,中文,,0,0,0,,这样做有什么效果？
Dialogue: 0,0:23:35.19,0:23:40.05,中文,,0,0,0,,这意味着现在尝试每种可能的密码不再需要大约一秒钟。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:40.05,0:23:41.79,中文,,0,0,0,,现在大约需要一分钟。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:41.79,0:23:43.41,中文,,0,0,0,,攻击方式还是一样的。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:43.41,0:23:50.87,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果现在每分钟只能猜一次密码或有 10 次猜测机会，速度就明显慢下来了，在这个例子中慢了 60 倍。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:50.87,0:23:56.34,中文,,0,0,0,,不幸的是，有人知道如果你在一分钟后再次输入错误会发生什么吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:23:56.34,0:23:59.10,中文,,0,0,0,,是的，时间会更长。 可能是 5 分钟，然后是 10 分钟。
Dialogue: 0,0:23:59.10,0:24:01.42,中文,,0,0,0,,Google 在这方面做得有点讨厌。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:01.42,0:24:03.14,中文,,0,0,0,,他们甚至没有给你一个时间范围。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:03.14,0:24:05.34,中文,,0,0,0,,他们只会说，稍后再试。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:05.34,0:24:09.45,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，这不仅将攻击者拒之门外，还可能将你自己拒之门外。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:09.45,0:24:11.05,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是权衡利弊所在。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:11.05,0:24:18.57,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你忘记了密码，如果你的手指现在有点湿，导致屏幕反应不灵敏，这些也可能是可用性方面的缺点。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:18.57,0:24:24.40,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，安全性实际上就是在这些各种权衡之间找到最佳点。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:24.40,0:24:25.84,中文,,0,0,0,,但还有其他机制。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:25.84,0:24:30.66,中文,,0,0,0,,你们中的一些人可能从 Gmail 中认出这个屏幕，当然，你是通过它登录的。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:30.66,0:24:42.34,中文,,0,0,0,,但是，在你登录 Gmail 或类似的网站、应用程序或工作系统之后，尤其是现在，你可能会看到所谓的双重身份验证。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:42.34,0:24:45.76,中文,,0,0,0,,简而言之，用外行人的话说，这是什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:24:45.76,0:24:52.32,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你们中的许多人在工作中进行任何数字操作，现在可能都必须这样做。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.32,0:24:57.16,中文,,0,0,0,,没错，你会在手机上收到一个额外的代码，这个代码与你的密码不同。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:57.16,0:24:59.55,中文,,0,0,0,,它通常是一个数字代码，可能有六位数长。
Dialogue: 0,0:24:59.55,0:25:01.57,中文,,0,0,0,,它在一分钟或十分钟后过期。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:01.57,0:25:03.17,中文,,0,0,0,,但这为什么是件好事呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.17,0:25:08.89,中文,,0,0,0,,首先，它不再仅仅是一条你知道的信息，或者你可能已经写下来的信息。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:08.89,0:25:12.29,中文,,0,0,0,,每次登录都会变化的信息。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:12.29,0:25:16.81,中文,,0,0,0,,但更重要的是，它本质上是第二个因素，这意味着它不仅仅是你知道的东西。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:16.81,0:25:19.35,中文,,0,0,0,,现在它是你拥有的东西，所以你，例如，
Dialogue: 0,0:25:19.35,0:25:22.32,中文,,0,0,0,,理论上是唯一应该收到验证码的人。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:22.32,0:25:32.86,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，如果攻击者想要进入你的帐户，他们不仅要猜测、暴力破解，或者从便利贴上读取你的密码，现在他们还必须物理上接触到你的手机。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:32.86,0:25:34.73,中文,,0,0,0,,所以仍然存在威胁，这是肯定的。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:34.73,0:25:39.89,中文,,0,0,0,,但它不再是互联网上任何拥有网络连接的人，现在只是星巴克里的人。

Dialogue: 0,0:25:41.41,0:25:45.29,中文,,0,0,0,,现在只有你家里的人可能接触到第二个因素。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:45.29,0:25:52.49,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，这也提高了攻击者的门槛，使其更难、更耗时、在地理位置上更不可能攻击你。
Dialogue: 0,0:25:52.49,0:25:54.85,中文,,0,0,0,,但双重身份验证的缺点是什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:25:54.85,0:26:01.43,中文,,0,0,0,,无论是设备，还是现在软件中，无论是在你的钥匙链上还是手机上，当你被提示输入验证码时。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:01.43,0:26:07.33,中文,,0,0,0,,正如我们中的一些人可能经历过的那样，有什么缺点？
Dialogue: 0,0:26:07.33,0:26:09.21,中文,,0,0,0,,你忘记带手机了，绝对正确？
Dialogue: 0,0:26:09.21,0:26:15.74,中文,,0,0,0,,你所拥有的因素，你却没有带在身边，或者你在某个地下室，没有信号，你在飞机上，你无法获得验证码。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:15.74,0:26:17.84,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，这里也存在这些权衡。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:17.84,0:26:21.58,中文,,0,0,0,,即使是 IT 部门也需要记住这一点，因为这对他们意味着什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:26:21.58,0:26:29.63,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你没有随身携带手机，并且你习惯于打电话给 IT 寻求帮助来解决这个问题，那么现在就有成本，人力成本，甚至可能是财务成本。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:29.63,0:26:39.01,中文,,0,0,0,,所以现在的 IT 策略实际上就是找到合适的平衡点，以及我们想要在哪里投入资源，但至少要提高攻击者的门槛。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:39.01,0:26:41.51,中文,,0,0,0,,当然，还有其他方法。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:41.51,0:26:44.94,中文,,0,0,0,,这将是今天之后我们其中一项家庭作业。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:44.94,0:26:46.90,中文,,0,0,0,,有一种软件叫密码管理器。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:46.90,0:26:53.26,中文,,0,0,0,,不用在手机上回答，就用手举起来示意下，有多少人使用密码管理器？
Dialogue: 0,0:26:53.26,0:26:57.43,中文,,0,0,0,,我估计一下，大概有 10% 到 20%。
Dialogue: 0,0:26:57.43,0:27:00.97,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们还有 80% 的增长空间，这可能也是个学习的机会。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:00.97,0:27:07.47,中文,,0,0,0,,密码管理器就是 Mac、PC 或手机上的一种软件，用来管理你的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.47,0:27:08.52,中文,,0,0,0,,这意味着什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:27:08.52,0:27:13.62,中文,,0,0,0,,当你第一次访问某个网站或下载某个应用程序时，需要创建一个帐户，
Dialogue: 0,0:27:13.62,0:27:18.22,中文,,0,0,0,,你仍然可以使用你的电子邮件地址或 David 作为用户名，或者你的名字。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:18.22,0:27:20.41,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你不需要改变这种方法。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.41,0:27:33.56,中文,,0,0,0,,但现在你不必像其他所有网站和应用程序一样，输入 123456 作为密码了，你可以使用密码管理器软件为你生成难以猜测的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:33.56,0:27:35.56,中文,,0,0,0,,也就是说，你告诉密码管理器，
Dialogue: 0,0:27:35.56,0:27:42.03,中文,,0,0,0,,给我一个 8 个字符的随机密码，不是 0000，而是包含标点符号、数字和字母的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:42.03,0:27:47.27,中文,,0,0,0,,顾名思义，密码管理器会为你记住这个密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:47.27,0:27:53.20,中文,,0,0,0,,下次你访问其他网站时，可以使用完全不同的密码再次执行此操作，用户名可以相同，也可以使用双重身份验证。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:53.20,0:27:56.12,中文,,0,0,0,,但密码不同，每个网站都不一样。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:56.12,0:27:57.16,中文,,0,0,0,,而且不一定是 8 位。
Dialogue: 0,0:27:57.16,0:28:01.39,中文,,0,0,0,,我通常使用 12 或 24 个字符。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:01.39,0:28:07.63,中文,,0,0,0,,在这种情况下，我甚至无法说出有多少种可能性，因为它远远超过了 quadrillion。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:07.63,0:28:13.14,中文,,0,0,0,,所以现在别人进入我其中一个帐户的概率非常非常低。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:13.14,0:28:18.80,中文,,0,0,0,,他们对我的兴趣会减少，也许会对那些没有使用那么好的密码的人更感兴趣。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:18.80,0:28:20.42,中文,,0,0,0,,那么，这实际上意味着什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:28:20.42,0:28:26.39,中文,,0,0,0,,当你登录那个托管网站时，你不再需要手动输入密码了。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:26.39,0:28:28.39,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上，你通常甚至不需要知道它。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:28.39,0:28:32.95,中文,,0,0,0,,如今，我可能不知道我 90% 以上，甚至 99% 的密码了。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:32.95,0:28:35.35,中文,,0,0,0,,我把它们托付给了这个密码管理器。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:35.35,0:28:40.38,中文,,0,0,0,,当然，你希望密码管理器本身是安全的。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:40.38,0:28:41.50,中文,,0,0,0,,那这意味着什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.50,0:28:46.76,中文,,0,0,0,,那些使用密码管理器的人，你们是如何访问这个软件本身的呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:28:46.76,0:28:48.61,中文,,0,0,0,,是什么保护着你的数据？
Dialogue: 0,0:28:48.61,0:28:50.63,中文,,0,0,0,,根据你的理解。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.63,0:28:56.69,中文,,0,0,0,,也许是生物识别技术，比如你的面部识别码，或者你的指纹，或者更简单的，还有什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:28:56.69,0:28:57.95,中文,,0,0,0,,也许只是一个密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:28:57.95,0:29:05.21,中文,,0,0,0,,希望那个密码，那个主密码，那个守门人，本身不是 123456。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:05.21,0:29:08.65,中文,,0,0,0,,否则，其他密码的安全程度就无关紧要了。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:08.65,0:29:12.46,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果你愿意付出努力，选择一个相当长的，
Dialogue: 0,0:29:12.46,0:29:17.18,中文,,0,0,0,,有点随机，非常难以猜测的密码，你保证记住它。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:17.18,0:29:26.66,中文,,0,0,0,,为了备份，你可以把它打印出来，放在保险箱里，或者藏在别人很难找到的地方。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:26.66,0:29:27.70,中文,,0,0,0,,那可能是个办法。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:27.70,0:29:34.73,中文,,0,0,0,,但另一方面，如果你忘记了主密码，你就失去了所有的一切。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:34.73,0:29:38.97,中文,,0,0,0,,如果有人获取了你的主密码，他们就能访问你所有的信息。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:38.97,0:29:40.37,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是取舍。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:40.37,0:29:52.72,中文,,0,0,0,,但我敢说，你身边的人对你造成的威胁，可能比互联网上数十亿有途径访问这些系统的人要小，这取决于你的家庭情况。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:52.72,0:29:53.94,中文,,0,0,0,,这也是一种取舍。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:53.94,0:29:57.88,中文,,0,0,0,,是否以这种方式管理密码，由你自己决定。
Dialogue: 0,0:29:57.88,0:30:06.48,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果你榜上有名，或者即使你没有，但你能想到好几个账号都使用了相同的密码，你很可能会从密码管理器中受益。
Dialogue: 0,0:30:06.48,0:30:15.95,中文,,0,0,0,,如果这个问题你从未想过，那我来明确地解释下，为什么在多个网站上使用相同的密码是不好的？
Dialogue: 0,0:30:15.95,0:30:20.57,中文,,0,0,0,,在不同的网站、不同的应用程序上重复使用密码，为什么不好？
Dialogue: 0,0:30:20.57,0:30:25.07,中文,,0,0,0,,有什么想法吗？后面的同学？
Dialogue: 0,0:30:25.07,0:30:38.56,中文,,0,0,0,,没错，一旦某个账户被攻击，攻击者很可能会顺藤摸瓜，\N 发现如果这个用户的用户名在这个网站上是 malan at harvard.edu，而他们的密码是愚蠢的 123456，或者更复杂的东西，
Dialogue: 0,0:30:38.56,0:30:48.56,中文,,0,0,0,,他们很可能会假设，如果我再大胆一点，用完全相同的密码，尝试访问 malan at harvard.edu 的其他账户和其他应用程序。
Dialogue: 0,0:30:48.56,0:30:52.58,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，从本质上讲，你是在将你的其他账户置于风险之中。
Dialogue: 0,0:30:52.58,0:30:55.21,中文,,0,0,0,,那么，我们至少可以从中得到什么启示？
Dialogue: 0,0:30:55.21,0:30:57.89,中文,,0,0,0,,我建议你重新审视一下你最重要的数据的密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:30:57.89,0:31:04.15,中文,,0,0,0,,也许是医疗信息，也许是财务信息，也许是电子邮件。任何你真的不想被别人访问的个人信息。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:04.15,0:31:07.55,中文,,0,0,0,,电子商务网站是否需要同等级别的安全保障？
Dialogue: 0,0:31:07.55,0:31:13.14,中文,,0,0,0,,那些你不太关心，或者你注册过一次之后就不再使用的购物网站呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:31:13.14,0:31:13.84,中文,,0,0,0,,可能不需要。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:13.84,0:31:15.46,中文,,0,0,0,,你自己决定。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:15.46,0:31:22.08,中文,,0,0,0,,但是，像密码管理器这样的软件，这只是一些可行的方案，可能会成为你的朋友。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:22.08,0:31:23.08,中文,,0,0,0,,其中一些是免费的。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:23.08,0:31:24.61,中文,,0,0,0,,它们随 Windows 或 Mac OS 系统附带。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:24.61,0:31:25.55,中文,,0,0,0,,有一些是商业软件。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:25.55,0:31:28.99,中文,,0,0,0,,哈佛大学也为学生提供了其中一种软件的网站许可证。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:28.99,0:31:30.91,中文,,0,0,0,,所以市面上有很多选择。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:30.91,0:31:32.43,中文,,0,0,0,,但是人们还用什么呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:31:32.43,0:31:35.09,中文,,0,0,0,,人们还可以用什么来确保系统的安全？
Dialogue: 0,0:31:35.09,0:31:36.53,中文,,0,0,0,,现如今我们大多数人
Dialogue: 0,0:31:36.53,0:31:41.30,中文,,0,0,0,,可能都听说过加密，这种扰乱信息的加密技术。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.30,0:31:50.94,中文,,0,0,0,,当你想要发送信息、电子邮件、上传照片或使用信用卡时，它不会被公开，而是经过某种方式加密。
Dialogue: 0,0:31:50.94,0:32:03.39,中文,,0,0,0,,一些高级的数学算法确保了加密，确保只有你（发送方）和接收方才能看到信用卡号码、信息内容、照片内容。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:03.39,0:32:09.66,中文,,0,0,0,,所以加密在今天很常见，无论是在网站、应用程序、ATM 机还是其他设备中。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:09.66,0:32:10.42,中文,,0,0,0,,但它是如何工作的？
Dialogue: 0,0:32:10.42,0:32:16.66,中文,,0,0,0,,在 CS50 的第二周，你的孩子学习了一些关于加密的知识，也称为密码学。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:16.66,0:32:21.31,中文,,0,0,0,,我们讨论过的一种算法非常简单，就像这样。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:21.31,0:32:24.91,中文,,0,0,0,,这不仅是 CS50，我们也可以称之为明文。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:24.91,0:32:27.49,中文,,0,0,0,,在这种情况下，是非常简单的英文文本。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:27.49,0:32:29.71,中文,,0,0,0,,显然，房间里的每个人都能读懂它。

Dialogue: 0,0:32:46.53,0:32:52.32,中文,,0,0,0,,你可能不会想说“这是 CS50”或“我爱你”，或任何稍微敏感的内容。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:52.32,0:32:54.28,中文,,0,0,0,,而是想加密它。
Dialogue: 0,0:32:54.28,0:33:10.28,中文,,0,0,0,,把 T 变成 U，H 变成 I，I 变成 J，S 变成 T，I 变成 J，\N S 再变成 T，C 变成 D，S 变成 T。我们不动数字，虽然我担心有人可能猜到这是什么意思。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:10.28,0:33:12.32,中文,,0,0,0,,但算法是什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:33:12.32,0:33:18.07,中文,,0,0,0,,我快速地说出这些变化时，无论是第二周的学生还是现在的家长。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:18.07,0:33:21.15,中文,,0,0,0,,没错，只是字母移位。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:21.15,0:33:25.95,中文,,0,0,0,,这更专业的叫法是旋转密码或凯撒密码。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:25.95,0:33:28.89,中文,,0,0,0,,以凯撒命名，在过去，它相对简单。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:28.89,0:33:34.58,中文,,0,0,0,,但在过去，如果你是世界上第一个使用它或想到它的人，它就不那么简单了。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:34.58,0:33:36.50,中文,,0,0,0,,但现在，我们实际上并不使用它。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:36.50,0:33:38.52,中文,,0,0,0,,但它在本质上同样是数学的。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:38.52,0:33:44.98,中文,,0,0,0,,它不像从现在我们所说的密文到明文那样简单地加一或减一。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:44.98,0:33:46.58,中文,,0,0,0,,但它同样涉及数学。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:46.58,0:33:49.38,中文,,0,0,0,,让我声明一下，数学的运作方式是，
Dialogue: 0,0:33:49.38,0:33:53.39,中文,,0,0,0,,发送方和接收方只需要记住某种秘密。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:53.39,0:33:56.47,中文,,0,0,0,,在这种情况下，秘密就是 1。
Dialogue: 0,0:33:56.47,0:34:04.90,中文,,0,0,0,,但它可能是一个更大的、更难猜到的数字，或者是我们共享的其他秘密，前提是我的同学、我在小学课堂上的老师，
Dialogue: 0,0:34:04.90,0:34:12.90,中文,,0,0,0,,如果他们不知道这个秘密是什么，不知道这个数字是什么，他们可以尝试暴力破解，尝试所有可能的数学运算，+ 1、+ 2、+ 3。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:12.90,0:34:14.10,中文,,0,0,0,,但这需要一些时间。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:14.10,0:34:15.62,中文,,0,0,0,,而且他们可能没那么在意。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:15.62,0:34:18.82,中文,,0,0,0,,因此，我的数据可能相对安全。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:18.82,0:34:21.02,中文,,0,0,0,,但现在加密无处不在。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:21.02,0:34:26.37,中文,,0,0,0,,例如，现在大多数 URL 的开头都是这样的，即使你自己没有输入。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:26.37,0:34:37.53,中文,,0,0,0,,话虽如此，Safari 甚至 Chrome 现在都在简化（或者说是弱化）用户界面，隐藏了像你我这样的普通用户不需要整天看到的细节。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:37.53,0:34:45.32,中文,,0,0,0,,但它确实存在。实际上，如果你在手机或笔记本电脑上点击 URL，即使它最初很短，你可能也会看到完整的 URL。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:45.32,0:34:47.68,中文,,0,0,0,,以这个开头。 S 代表安全。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:47.68,0:34:49.56,中文,,0,0,0,,S 表示正在使用加密。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:49.56,0:34:52.70,中文,,0,0,0,,但这还有其他形式，不仅仅是在你访问网站的时候。
Dialogue: 0,0:34:52.70,0:35:01.17,中文,,0,0,0,,现在越来越多的人谈论端到端加密，特别是在新冠疫情期间，我们中有更多的人在使用视频，
Dialogue: 0,0:35:01.17,0:35:09.77,中文,,0,0,0,,谈论更敏感的事情，比如远程医疗，与医生交谈，这些事情你也不希望像文字一样被泄露出去。
Dialogue: 0,0:35:09.77,0:35:18.67,中文,,0,0,0,,端到端加密与 HTTPS 以及我们大多数人每天在网站上使用的加密类型有什么不同？
Dialogue: 0,0:35:18.67,0:35:29.36,中文,,0,0,0,,端到端加密是一种更好的功能，在使用 Zoom、Microsoft Teams、WhatsApp 等服务时，你应该越来越多地寻求这种功能。
Dialogue: 0,0:35:29.36,0:35:31.40,中文,,0,0,0,,有什么想法吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:35:31.40,0:35:32.26,中文,,0,0,0,,是的，右边那位。
Dialogue: 0,0:35:39.17,0:35:47.04,中文,,0,0,0,,很好，所以加密，也就是信息的 scrambling，发生在信息的来源（发送方）和目的地（接收方），中间没有所谓的中间人。
Dialogue: 0,0:35:47.04,0:36:00.15,中文,,0,0,0,,这实际上与现在大多数只使用 HTTPS 的情况非常不同，因为当你使用 HTTPS 在 Amazon 上用信用卡安全地购物时，Amazon 最终需要解密信息。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:00.15,0:36:01.27,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这没问题。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:01.27,0:36:06.97,中文,,0,0,0,,但即使在你使用视频会议或现在的短信服务时也是如此。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:06.97,0:36:09.34,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你使用 WhatsApp，它属于 Meta 公司。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:09.34,0:36:11.56,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你使用 Instagram，它也属于 Meta 公司。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:11.56,0:36:15.02,中文,,0,0,0,,在我们使用的这些应用程序中，有很多中间人。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:15.02,0:36:27.95,中文,,0,0,0,,如果他们只使用加密，或者只使用类似HTTPS的东西，那么你与WhatsApp的连接，以及反过来，与接收者的连接，在通道的两端很可能是安全的。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:27.95,0:36:39.29,中文,,0,0,0,,但是 Meta，作为中间的公司，或者任何其他的中间公司，\N 理论上，无论好坏，都可以查看这些数据，无论是为了广告目的而挖掘数据，还是为了窥探你发送的数据。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:39.29,0:36:45.39,中文,,0,0,0,,如果中间人（通常是公司）在技术上能够访问这些数据，那就不是端到端加密。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:45.39,0:36:58.60,中文,,0,0,0,,现在，Zoom、Microsoft Teams、WhatsApp、iMessage 以及你熟悉的其他服务，越来越多地提供更强大的加密保证，确保数据只在通信双方之间传递，而不是中间人。
Dialogue: 0,0:36:58.60,0:37:03.91,中文,,0,0,0,,当然，这也有缺点。你可以在某些设置中看到这种功能的表现形式。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:03.91,0:37:08.83,中文,,0,0,0,,例如，除了 iMessage，它只在 iPhone 或 Mac 上为你提供这种功能。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:08.83,0:37:13.12,中文,,0,0,0,,除了 Zoom，你实际上可以在 Zoom 中微调这些设置。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:13.12,0:37:21.10,中文,,0,0,0,,这是我昨晚截取的屏幕截图，展示了使用最新版 Zoom 软件创建新会议时的用户界面。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:21.10,0:37:25.11,中文,,0,0,0,,你可能不知道，这里可以选择按钮。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:25.11,0:37:31.57,中文,,0,0,0,,默认情况下，你的按钮很可能是“增强加密”，这是一个很棒的营销话术，因为它只是加密。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:31.57,0:37:32.49,中文,,0,0,0,,它并没有增强。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:32.49,0:37:35.34,中文,,0,0,0,,讽刺的是，它实际上比这更糟糕。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:35.34,0:37:37.38,中文,,0,0,0,,但他们很可能希望你使用它。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:37.38,0:37:38.06,中文,,0,0,0,,为什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:37:38.06,0:37:39.56,中文,,0,0,0,,因为它更容易实现。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:39.56,0:37:42.02,中文,,0,0,0,,他们在计算上的成本更低。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:42.02,0:37:48.43,中文,,0,0,0,,公平地说，增强加密确实会对数据进行加密，但 Zoom 仍然可以看到它。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:48.43,0:37:51.59,中文,,0,0,0,,Zoom 确实可以看到它，但这在某些情况下实际上是一个优势。
Dialogue: 0,0:37:51.59,0:37:57.95,中文,,0,0,0,,因为如果你想进行云录制，并且想将会议录制到 Zoom 上而不是你的 Mac 或 PC 上。
