Dialogue: 0,0:16:59.57,0:17:08.55,英文,,0,0,0,,So what I'm going to point out here is that when the player actually doesn't do that well, the game is actually trying to help them by making the game length easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:59.57,0:17:08.55,中文,,0,0,0,,我要指出的是  当玩家表现不佳时  游戏实际上试图通过降低游戏难度来帮助他们
Dialogue: 0,0:17:08.55,0:17:12.87,英文,,0,0,0,,So I wouldn't say it's necessarily becoming too hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:08.55,0:17:12.87,中文,,0,0,0,,我不会说它一定会变得太难

Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.24,0:17:25.19,英文,,0,0,0,,So there's no motivation for you to get better, because even if you just don't do well, you can just rely on the game giving you good stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.24,0:17:25.19,中文,,0,0,0,,你就没有动力去提高自己  因为即使你表现不好  你也可以依靠游戏给你好东西

Dialogue: 0,0:17:47.97,0:17:57.28,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, one thing you might notice is that these type of negative feedbacks are actually better suited for party games, where people shouldn't be judged on their skill or something.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:47.97,0:17:57.28,中文,,0,0,0,,你可能会注意到  这类负反馈实际上更适合聚会游戏  在这些游戏中  人们不应该以他们的技术或其他东西来评判

Dialogue: 0,0:29:06.40,0:29:11.18,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们要考虑如何实现这个功能
Dialogue: 0,0:29:11.18,0:29:19.26,英文,,0,0,0,,So if we recall how the basic build run works because we want to build our foundations, you would do this in a while loop.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:11.18,0:29:19.26,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们回顾一下基本的构建运行原理  因为我们想构建基础  你会在一个 while 循环中进行操作

Dialogue: 0,0:29:19.26,0:29:25.97,中文,,0,0,0,,流程是：处理输入、更新世界状态  然后将当前状态渲染给用户
Dialogue: 0,0:29:25.97,0:29:35.85,英文,,0,0,0,,Now you also want to wait a little bit until the next update because you want the game maybe run at 60 frames per second or something.

Dialogue: 0,0:29:35.85,0:29:40.16,中文,,0,0,0,,关于保持代码整洁
Dialogue: 0,0:29:40.16,0:29:47.56,英文,,0,0,0,,So in our Build Your Own World with Encounters, there are actually different scenes.

Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.55,0:30:05.03,英文,,0,0,0,,So the problem is that each scene will have different things to update.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.55,0:30:05.03,中文,,0,0,0,,问题是每个场景都需要更新不同的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:30:05.03,0:30:12.91,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you're in the world scene, you render blocks and process WSD, but if you're in the encounter scene,

Dialogue: 0,0:30:59.01,0:31:01.65,中文,,0,0,0,,这是我们的第一个方案
Dialogue: 0,0:31:01.65,0:31:04.29,英文,,0,0,0,,We're going to have nested while loops.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:01.65,0:31:04.29,中文,,0,0,0,,我们将使用嵌套的 while 循环

Dialogue: 0,0:31:14.28,0:31:19.84,中文,,0,0,0,,但我们不喜欢这种方式的一点是如果你想创建一个新场景
Dialogue: 0,0:31:19.84,0:31:25.96,英文,,0,0,0,,you're going to add another nested wild over here.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:19.84,0:31:25.96,中文,,0,0,0,,你就要在这里添加另一个嵌套的 while 循环
Dialogue: 0,0:31:25.96,0:31:31.76,英文,,0,0,0,,This hurts the readability, because the more you indent, the more complicated your code becomes.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:25.96,0:31:31.76,中文,,0,0,0,,这损害了代码的可读性  因为缩进越多  代码就越复杂
Dialogue: 0,0:31:31.76,0:31:47.16,英文,,0,0,0,,Actually, it's not possible to switch back and forth between three scenes using these, because you couldn't just ignore that and then go to the outermost immediately.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:31.76,0:31:47.16,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上  使用这些方法不可能在三个场景之间来回切换  因为你不能简单地忽略它  然后立即跳转到最外层
Dialogue: 0,0:31:47.16,0:31:50.75,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, here's a better approach, but it could still be improved.

Dialogue: 0,0:32:23.51,0:32:28.85,英文,,0,0,0,,You do like a bunch of different equal checks every time, and just to elaborate a little bit on that, let's say you want to add a new scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:23.51,0:32:28.85,中文,,0,0,0,,每次你都要做一堆不同的相等检查  为了更详细地说明这一点  假设你想添加一个新的场景
Dialogue: 0,0:32:28.85,0:32:29.63,英文,,0,0,0,,What would you do?
Dialogue: 0,0:32:28.85,0:32:29.63,中文,,0,0,0,,你会怎么做？

Dialogue: 0,0:32:33.25,0:32:38.52,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, you need to add another statement, and that's something we kind of don't want
Dialogue: 0,0:32:33.25,0:32:38.52,中文,,0,0,0,,是的  你需要添加另一个语句  而这是我们不希望看到的
Dialogue: 0,0:32:38.52,0:32:46.52,英文,,0,0,0,,because your game is just going to have if, else, if, else, if repeated a hundred times, and that just doesn't look very clean.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:38.52,0:32:46.52,中文,,0,0,0,,因为你的游戏将会有 if、else、if、else、if 重复上百次  这看起来很不简洁

Dialogue: 0,0:33:47.60,0:33:50.69,中文,,0,0,0,,所以它很像
Dialogue: 0,0:33:50.69,0:33:53.89,英文,,0,0,0,,The vertices are just the states that the machine could be in.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:50.69,0:33:53.89,中文,,0,0,0,,这些顶点表示机器可能处于的状态

Dialogue: 0,0:35:37.44,0:35:46.10,英文,,0,0,0,,So here's how you could potentially implement a finite state machine in code.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:37.44,0:35:46.10,中文,,0,0,0,,那么  这里是如何在代码中实现有限状态机
Dialogue: 0,0:35:46.10,0:35:52.71,英文,,0,0,0,,So you're going to have something that represents your current state machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:46.10,0:35:52.71,中文,,0,0,0,,所以  你要有一个东西来表示你当前的状态机
Dialogue: 0,0:35:52.71,0:35:57.15,英文,,0,0,0,,And then you're going to have your main game loop.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:52.71,0:35:57.15,中文,,0,0,0,,然后  你要有你的主游戏循环
Dialogue: 0,0:35:57.15,0:36:05.67,英文,,0,0,0,,So you read the input, you do some updates based on the input, and then you render to the user.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:57.15,0:36:05.67,中文,,0,0,0,,你读取输入  根据输入做一些更新  然后渲染给用户

Dialogue: 0,0:36:17.88,0:36:23.31,英文,,0,0,0,,So you're going to initialize all the individual game states, and then you're going to have a current state.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:17.88,0:36:23.31,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你要初始化所有单独的游戏状态  然后你还要有一个当前状态
Dialogue: 0,0:36:23.31,0:36:32.73,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, the state machine is going to have an update method, which basically gets the current state and then calls the update of that state.

Dialogue: 0,0:36:32.73,0:36:35.27,中文,,0,0,0,,然后那里只有一行代码
Dialogue: 0,0:36:35.27,0:36:38.18,英文,,0,0,0,,And then the render is just going to call the render of that state.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:35.27,0:36:38.18,中文,,0,0,0,,然后渲染只会调用该状态的渲染
Dialogue: 0,0:36:38.18,0:36:40.30,英文,,0,0,0,,So it's pretty bare bones.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:38.18,0:36:40.30,中文,,0,0,0,,所以它很精简
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.30,0:36:41.28,英文,,0,0,0,,It doesn't have anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.30,0:36:41.28,中文,,0,0,0,,它什么都没有

Dialogue: 0,0:36:47.50,0:36:51.27,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you have change state, well, change state needs two things.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:47.50,0:36:51.27,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你改变状态  那么改变状态需要两件事
Dialogue: 0,0:36:51.27,0:36:58.37,英文,,0,0,0,,You need to execute the exit function and the enter function of the target state.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:51.27,0:36:58.37,中文,,0,0,0,,你需要执行目标状态的退出函数和进入函数
Dialogue: 0,0:36:58.37,0:37:07.07,英文,,0,0,0,,And then I'm just going to define an interface of game state that has all the pressed, render, enter, exit.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:58.37,0:37:07.07,中文,,0,0,0,,然后  我将定义一个游戏状态的接口  它具有所有的按键、渲染、进入、退出
Dialogue: 0,0:37:07.07,0:37:16.09,英文,,0,0,0,,So now, if I want to add new game states, I could just implement that game state interface.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:07.07,0:37:16.09,中文,,0,0,0,,现在  如果我想添加新的游戏状态  我只需要实现那个游戏状态接口
Dialogue: 0,0:37:16.09,0:37:18.71,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, this was from last slides.

Dialogue: 0,0:37:26.35,0:37:35.52,中文,,0,0,0,,然后  如果你踩到门上  你就会调用 mach.changeState("encounter")进入遭遇战
Dialogue: 0,0:37:35.52,0:37:39.82,英文,,0,0,0,,And then the render is just gonna draw the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:35.52,0:37:39.82,中文,,0,0,0,,然后渲染器就会绘制世界
Dialogue: 0,0:37:39.82,0:37:43.56,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, public class encounter state, this is another game state.

Dialogue: 0,0:37:54.53,0:38:04.27,英文,,0,0,0,,Now if you want the encounter, you're going to call another change state, and you're going to maybe go back to the world, or you can just go to the win stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:54.53,0:38:04.27,中文,,0,0,0,,现在  如果你想要结束遭遇战  你将调用另一个 mach.changeState  你可能会回到世界  或者你可以直接进入胜利阶段

Dialogue: 0,0:38:04.27,0:38:07.05,中文,,0,0,0,,是的  然后还有另一个渲染方法
Dialogue: 0,0:38:07.05,0:38:11.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, how does the game exactly know which update and render to call?
Dialogue: 0,0:38:07.05,0:38:11.76,中文,,0,0,0,,那么  游戏究竟是如何知道要调用哪个更新和渲染的呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:38:11.76,0:38:15.78,英文,,0,0,0,,Remember in Java, we have this method overwriting,
