Dialogue: 0,0:32:50.80,0:32:55.26,英文,,0,0,0,,because n is, as we learn from the asymptotic sector, it's huge.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:50.80,0:32:55.26,中文,,0,0,0,,因为n  正如我们从渐近分析中学到的  它是巨大的
Dialogue: 0,0:32:55.26,0:33:02.17,英文,,0,0,0,,So, n log k is going to be significantly better than n log n.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:55.26,0:33:02.17,中文,,0,0,0,,所以  N log K将明显优于N log N
