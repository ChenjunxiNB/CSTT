Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.12,0:05:10.86,中文,,0,0,0,,以下是我经常从学生那里听到的一句话
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.86,0:05:21.34,英文,,0,0,0,,Instead of wasting time designing my program, I can save time by starting to code now, said by a person who will regret their decision very, very, very soon.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.86,0:05:21.34,中文,,0,0,0,,与其浪费时间设计程序 不如直接开搞 这是那些很快就会后悔自己决定的家伙说的话

Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.87,0:05:33.37,中文,,0,0,0,,我还是直接开写吧
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.37,0:05:39.22,英文,,0,0,0,,I'm here to tell you that design is an important first stage of development for the following reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.37,0:05:39.22,中文,,0,0,0,,我来告诉你 设计是开发中重要的第一步 原因如下：
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.22,0:05:46.97,英文,,0,0,0,,First of all, spending time to design your code before you actually start writing anything ensures consideration of all requirements and constraints.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.22,0:05:46.97,中文,,0,0,0,,首先 在真正开始写代码之前花时间设计可以确保考虑所有需求和限制
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.97,0:05:54.99,英文,,0,0,0,,In the context of this class, this means that you actually think about the spec, how you're going to meet every part of the spec, and how you're going to pass all those tests.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.97,0:05:54.99,中文,,0,0,0,,就这门课而言 这意味着你得仔细考虑规范 如何满足规范的每一部分 以及如何通过所有测试
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.99,0:06:01.66,英文,,0,0,0,,I've seen so many times students code out their entire project and then realize at the end, oh, I missed part of the spec.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.99,0:06:01.66,中文,,0,0,0,,我见过太多学生把整个项目代码写完后才意识到：“哦 我漏掉了规范的一部分”
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.66,0:06:05.88,英文,,0,0,0,,And this requires going back, changing their code, rewriting a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.66,0:06:05.88,中文,,0,0,0,,这就需要回头修改代码 重写很多东西
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.88,0:06:07.28,英文,,0,0,0,,I do not want to see this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.88,0:06:07.28,中文,,0,0,0,,我不想看到这种情况

Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.28,0:06:08.92,中文,,0,0,0,,这种情况在业界也时有发生
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.92,0:06:16.22,英文,,0,0,0,,When people forget, for example, to integrate security into their program, then all of a sudden they have to go back,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.92,0:06:16.22,中文,,0,0,0,,例如 当人们忘记将安全性集成到程序中时 他们就不得不回头
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.22,0:06:24.22,英文,,0,0,0,, try to work security into a program which is already fully fleshed out, which just results in a poor, bad implementation on every side.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.22,0:06:24.22,中文,,0,0,0,,试图将安全性融入到已经完全成型的程序中 这只会导致各个方面的糟糕实现

Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.22,0:06:28.76,中文,,0,0,0,,它考虑了多种方案及其相对优缺点
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.76,0:06:34.20,英文,,0,0,0,,Something I see a lot is people pick the first thing that comes to mind, the easiest thing that comes to mind,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.76,0:06:34.20,中文,,0,0,0,,我经常看到人们选择第一个想到的东西 也就是最简单的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.20,0:06:37.77,英文,,0,0,0,,But oftentimes, your first thought is not your best thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.20,0:06:37.77,中文,,0,0,0,,但通常 你的第一个想法并不是你最好的想法
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.77,0:06:49.69,英文,,0,0,0,,And if you start going down one way, you may realize that you failed to consider that this program actually has some constraints, which this way may not actually be able to achieve.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.77,0:06:49.69,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你开始朝一个方向走 你可能会意识到你没有考虑到这个程序实际上有一些限制 而这种方法实际上可能无法实现

Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.69,0:06:53.29,中文,,0,0,0,,它可以识别潜在的成本或陷阱 而改变的成本很低
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.29,0:06:59.28,英文,,0,0,0,,Another thing I see a lot is when students start coding, they will run into a bug.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.29,0:06:59.28,中文,,0,0,0,,我经常看到的另一件事是 当学生开始编码时 他们会遇到 bug
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.28,0:07:04.04,英文,,0,0,0,,And then they'll say, oh, actually, I can fix this really quick with a couple of Band-Aid lines.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.28,0:07:04.04,中文,,0,0,0,,然后他们会说：“哦 实际上 我可以用几行补丁代码快速解决这个问题”
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.04,0:07:05.58,英文,,0,0,0,,It works. They move on.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.04,0:07:05.58,中文,,0,0,0,,它可以工作  他们继续前进
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.58,0:07:06.68,英文,,0,0,0,,Another bug pops up.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.58,0:07:06.68,中文,,0,0,0,,又出现一个 bug 了

Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.50,0:07:13.47,中文,,0,0,0,,这种情况发生多了 突然间你就有了 20、30 个补丁
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.47,0:07:17.23,英文,,0,0,0,,Your entire code base is patches, not actually something that's meant to work.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.47,0:07:17.23,中文,,0,0,0,,你的整个代码库都是补丁 而不是真正能用的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.23,0:07:20.95,英文,,0,0,0,,And then eventually, one way or another, it just all goes kabloom.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.23,0:07:20.95,中文,,0,0,0,,然后最终 总有一天 它会全部崩溃
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.95,0:07:27.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Everything goes bad, and you have no idea how anything works because your code is just patches on top of patches.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.95,0:07:27.60,中文,,0,0,0,,一切都会变糟 你完全不知道任何东西是怎么工作的 因为你的代码只是补丁叠补丁
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.60,0:07:36.44,英文,,0,0,0,,This isn't very fun. But something that I see a lot from students is they'll say, well, it would be so much effort to restart that I don't even want to start from scratch again.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.60,0:07:36.44,中文,,0,0,0,,这不好玩  但我经常看到学生们说 重新开始需要付出太多努力 我甚至不想从头再来

Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.27,0:07:43.19,中文,,0,0,0,,你陷入了沉没成本谬误
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.19,0:07:52.87,英文,,0,0,0,,In reality, we can avoid this by spending time to think about what a good design would be up front so we don't have to take the time to start from scratch over again.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.19,0:07:52.87,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上 我们可以通过花时间思考好的设计是什么来避免这种情况 这样我们就不必花时间从头再来

Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.32,0:08:05.56,英文,,0,0,0,,By actually taking the time to write down what you want your program to do on a design document, this becomes something you can easily disseminate within your team.
