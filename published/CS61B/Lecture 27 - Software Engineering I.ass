Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.10,0:02:27.50,中文,,0,0,0,,但现在你要考虑权衡取舍
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.50,0:02:28.93,英文,,0,0,0,,Why use a specific option?

Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.53,0:02:33.07,中文,,0,0,0,,而这正是工程学的意义所在
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.07,0:02:35.83,英文,,0,0,0,,So you're applying these in larger scale projects.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.07,0:02:35.83,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你在更大的项目中应用这些
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.83,0:02:41.43,英文,,0,0,0,,You now have to abide by some of our requirements, our specifications, so you don't get complete control.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.83,0:02:41.43,中文,,0,0,0,,你现在必须遵守一些我们的要求、我们的规范 所以你没有完全的控制权
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.43,0:02:47.61,英文,,0,0,0,,But you should have noticed by now that compared to the 61A projects, where you had to fill out one function
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.43,0:02:47.61,中文,,0,0,0,,但你现在应该已经注意到 与61A的项目相比 在那里你必须填写一个函数
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.61,0:02:54.61,英文,,0,0,0,,and you got a doc string telling you what to do and how to do it, it's a little bit more challenging to take these ideas of design and apply them in reality.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.61,0:02:54.61,中文,,0,0,0,,并且有一个文档字符串告诉你做什么以及如何做 将这些设计思想应用到现实中要困难得多
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.61,0:02:58.09,英文,,0,0,0,,And the best way, of course, to learn that is through examples, through doing it yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.61,0:02:58.09,中文,,0,0,0,,当然 学习的最佳方式是通过例子 通过自己动手
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.09,0:03:00.58,英文,,0,0,0,,That's why we have you do these larger projects.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.09,0:03:00.58,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么我们让你做这些更大的项目
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.58,0:03:07.52,英文,,0,0,0,,But it's also interesting to note that these are just really like a sampling of the larger ideas that's actually a lot more complicated in reality.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.58,0:03:07.52,中文,,0,0,0,,但同样有趣的是 要注意到这些实际上只是更大想法的样本 在现实中要复杂得多
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.52,0:03:11.91,英文,,0,0,0,,And hopefully, this lecture will give some insight into what that looks like.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.52,0:03:11.91,中文,,0,0,0,,希望这节课能让你了解一下这些想法是什么样的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.91,0:03:15.70,英文,,0,0,0,,Project 3, your next project after Project 2, is about building your own world.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.70,0:03:29.38,英文,,0,0,0,,And really, we try to let you be as creative as you possibly can so that way you get the challenges and the joy and the experiences of building out what it means to design a larger scale project on your own.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.70,0:03:29.38,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上 我们尽量让你发挥最大的创造力 这样你就能体验到自己设计一个更大规模项目所带来的挑战、快乐和经验
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.38,0:03:37.02,英文,,0,0,0,,OK, with that, let's now go into what I mean by code complexity, the first sort of theory part of the lecture.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.38,0:03:37.02,中文,,0,0,0,,好的 接下来让我们来了解一下我所说的代码复杂性 这是这节课的第一部分理论内容
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.02,0:03:44.89,英文,,0,0,0,,And I want to start out with talking actually not about computer science, but more just engineering in general, like all forms of engineering.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:10.10,0:19:17.46,中文,,0,0,0,,好 现在我们来聊聊一些框架 可以用它们来解决我刚才提到的代码复杂性问题
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.46,0:19:20.25,英文,,0,0,0,,And we're going to start with something called tactical programming.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.46,0:19:20.25,中文,,0,0,0,,我们将从“战术编程”开始
Dialogue: 0,0:19:20.25,0:19:23.85,英文,,0,0,0,,And as the name implies, the idea is that you're focusing on specific tactics.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:20.25,0:19:23.85,中文,,0,0,0,,顾名思义 它的理念是专注于特定的战术

Dialogue: 0,0:19:23.85,0:19:26.25,中文,,0,0,0,,你只想快速让一些东西跑起来
Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.25,0:19:30.94,英文,,0,0,0,,And so you're going to leverage a lot of workarounds and a lot of shortcuts to get this done.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.25,0:19:30.94,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你会利用很多变通方法和捷径来完成这件事
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.94,0:19:31.98,英文,,0,0,0,,So here's an example.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.94,0:19:31.98,中文,,0,0,0,,举个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.98,0:19:32.96,英文,,0,0,0,,Maybe this sounds familiar.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.98,0:19:32.96,中文,,0,0,0,,也许这听起来很熟悉
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.96,0:19:38.19,英文,,0,0,0,,I know that when I took the class, this was me a lot of the time, which is that if your code doesn't pass a test,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.96,0:19:38.19,中文,,0,0,0,,我记得我上课的时候 很多时候我就是这样的：如果你的代码没有通过测试
Dialogue: 0,0:19:38.19,0:19:43.19,英文,,0,0,0,,you go back to your code and you add an if statement to handle that one case, and then you run the test again.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:38.19,0:19:43.19,中文,,0,0,0,,你就回到代码中 添加一个 if 语句来处理那个特定的情况 然后你再次运行测试

Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.19,0:19:47.03,中文,,0,0,0,,然后 通过添加那个 if 语句 你之前通过的测试现在失败了
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.03,0:19:49.13,英文,,0,0,0,,And so now you're trying to figure out, well, what if statement do I add?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.03,0:19:49.13,中文,,0,0,0,,所以现在你在想 好吧 我该添加什么 if 语句呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:19:49.13,0:19:55.26,英文,,0,0,0,,So you go back and you add two more if statements, one for each individual case, and then you fail now a different set of tests.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:49.13,0:19:55.26,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你回去 为每个单独的情况添加两个 if 语句 然后你现在又失败了一组不同的测试
Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.26,0:19:56.38,英文,,0,0,0,,Does that sound familiar to anyone?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.26,0:19:56.38,中文,,0,0,0,,这听起来对任何人熟悉吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.38,0:19:59.15,英文,,0,0,0,,That's actually exactly how I approach the class.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.38,0:19:59.15,中文,,0,0,0,,那实际上就是我上课的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.15,0:20:02.15,英文,,0,0,0,,And I think that that is something that is sometimes true.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.15,0:20:02.15,中文,,0,0,0,,我认为这有时确实如此
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.15,0:20:04.19,英文,,0,0,0,,There are actual applications of this.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.15,0:20:04.19,中文,,0,0,0,,它确实有实际应用
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.19,0:20:10.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you're building a prototype, if you're building a proof of concept, maybe you're working on a startup, and you have a pitch to some VC fund.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.19,0:20:10.21,中文,,0,0,0,,所以 如果你正在构建一个原型 如果你正在构建一个概念验证 也许你正在创业 并且你要向某个风险投资基金做演示

Dialogue: 0,0:20:16.74,0:20:18.80,中文,,0,0,0,,但他们想看到一些东西能运行
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.80,0:20:21.01,英文,,0,0,0,,So in that case, it makes a lot of sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.80,0:20:21.01,中文,,0,0,0,,所以在那种情况下 这很有意义
Dialogue: 0,0:20:21.01,0:20:26.73,英文,,0,0,0,,But in general, there are some issues, as you can kind of tell where I'm going with this.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:21.01,0:20:26.73,中文,,0,0,0,,但总的来说 有一些问题 就像你可以猜到我要说的那样
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.73,0:20:29.73,英文,,0,0,0,,The first one being that we didn't really spend any time on the design.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.73,0:20:29.73,中文,,0,0,0,,第一个问题是 我们没有真正花时间在设计上
Dialogue: 0,0:20:29.73,0:20:31.18,英文,,0,0,0,,We're just trying to get something working.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:29.73,0:20:31.18,中文,,0,0,0,,我们只是想让一些东西能运行
Dialogue: 0,0:20:31.18,0:20:36.98,英文,,0,0,0,,And so if that's your goal, you're trying to modify your code and try to push it into this thing that works.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:31.18,0:20:36.98,中文,,0,0,0,,所以 如果这是你的目标 你就会试图修改你的代码 并试图把它推到这个能运行的东西里
Dialogue: 0,0:20:36.98,0:20:39.18,英文,,0,0,0,,Second is that it's also very complicated.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:36.98,0:20:39.18,中文,,0,0,0,,第二点是它也很复杂
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.18,0:20:45.35,英文,,0,0,0,,The more if statements, the more edge cases that you're trying to handle, the more complicated your code becomes.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.18,0:20:45.35,中文,,0,0,0,,你试图处理的 if 语句越多 边缘情况越多 你的代码就越复杂
Dialogue: 0,0:20:45.35,0:20:52.11,英文,,0,0,0,,And also, if you want to refactor, if you do realize, hey, I actually want to restart, I thought of a different way to do this, you might have to restart.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:45.35,0:20:52.11,中文,,0,0,0,,而且 如果你想重构 如果你确实意识到 嘿 我实际上想重新开始 我想到了一个不同的方法来做这件事 你可能必须重新开始
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.11,0:20:54.01,英文,,0,0,0,,And a great example of this is project 2.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.11,0:20:54.01,中文,,0,0,0,,一个很好的例子就是项目2
Dialogue: 0,0:20:54.01,0:21:00.24,英文,,0,0,0,,If you missed the runtime requirements part in the spec of how every method is supposed to operate, and you built a constructor
Dialogue: 0,0:20:54.01,0:21:00.24,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你错过了规范中关于每个方法应该如何操作的运行时要求部分 并且你构建了一个构造函数
Dialogue: 0,0:21:00.24,0:21:06.24,英文,,0,0,0,,that just takes in all the files and just keeps them as strings, well, now you have to go back, delete the constructor, delete all the work
Dialogue: 0,0:21:00.24,0:21:06.24,中文,,0,0,0,,它只接受所有文件并将它们保留为字符串 那么 现在你必须返回 删除构造函数
Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.24,0:21:12.24,英文,,0,0,0,,that you had on every single method, and go back to square one and plan how are you going to attack the runtime requirements.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.24,0:21:12.24,中文,,0,0,0,,删除你在每个方法上的所有工作 然后回到起点 并计划如何处理运行时要求
Dialogue: 0,0:21:12.24,0:21:19.70,英文,,0,0,0,,And this is actually a very powerful idea because that prototype that I talked about before often actually gets deployed into the real world due to a lack of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:12.24,0:21:19.70,中文,,0,0,0,,这实际上是一个非常强大的想法 因为我之前谈到的那个原型 由于缺乏时间 通常实际上会被部署到现实世界中
Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.70,0:21:26.50,英文,,0,0,0,,So it turns out that a lot of early startups, a lot of early companies that are using these workarounds end up pushing that code into the real world.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.70,0:21:26.50,中文,,0,0,0,,所以事实证明 很多早期的初创公司 很多使用这些变通方法的早期公司 最终都会将这些代码推向现实世界
Dialogue: 0,0:21:26.50,0:21:29.62,英文,,0,0,0,,So Microsoft is actually a pretty good example of this.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:26.50,0:21:29.62,中文,,0,0,0,,微软实际上就是一个很好的例子
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.62,0:21:35.37,英文,,0,0,0,,When they built Windows way back when, a lot of their legacy code still exists in the code base today.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.62,0:21:35.37,中文,,0,0,0,,当他们在很久以前构建 Windows 时 他们的很多遗留代码仍然存在于今天的代码库中
Dialogue: 0,0:21:35.37,0:21:41.35,英文,,0,0,0,,It's actually so hard to try to get rid of it that their approach is just like they just add new functionality on top of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:35.37,0:21:41.35,中文,,0,0,0,,实际上 想要摆脱它太难了 所以他们的方法就像是在上面添加新功能一样
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.35,0:21:44.23,英文,,0,0,0,,So in Windows, you have a control panel.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.35,0:21:44.23,中文,,0,0,0,,所以在 Windows 中 你有一个控制面板
Dialogue: 0,0:21:44.23,0:21:46.68,英文,,0,0,0,,And then they wanted to make a new setting system.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:44.23,0:21:46.68,中文,,0,0,0,,然后他们想做一个新的设置系统
Dialogue: 0,0:21:46.68,0:21:48.62,英文,,0,0,0,,And so they just built a new setting system.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:46.68,0:21:48.62,中文,,0,0,0,,所以他们就构建了一个新的设置系统
Dialogue: 0,0:21:48.62,0:21:52.30,英文,,0,0,0,,And then there's also the old control panel there, because you just can't remove it.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:48.62,0:21:52.30,中文,,0,0,0,,然后还有旧的控制面板在那里 因为你就是无法删除它
Dialogue: 0,0:21:52.30,0:21:57.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So it's very important to notice that it seems like in an idealistic world, no company obviously would ever do this.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:52.30,0:21:57.21,中文,,0,0,0,,所以 重要的是要注意 在理想世界中 显然没有哪家公司会这样做
Dialogue: 0,0:21:57.21,0:22:02.33,英文,,0,0,0,,But it's actually a lot more common than it seems.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:57.21,0:22:02.33,中文,,0,0,0,,但这实际上比看起来要普遍得多
Dialogue: 0,0:22:02.33,0:22:04.85,英文,,0,0,0,,So the other one that we can do is strategic programming.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:02.33,0:22:04.85,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们可以做的另一个是“战略编程”
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.85,0:22:08.99,英文,,0,0,0,,Instead of doing just the specific tactic, we think about this more generally.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.85,0:22:08.99,中文,,0,0,0,,我们不是只做特定的战术 而是更普遍地考虑这个问题
Dialogue: 0,0:22:08.99,0:22:11.90,英文,,0,0,0,,The key word here is we think about long-term strategy.

Dialogue: 0,0:22:11.90,0:22:17.92,英文,,0,0,0,,So we're thinking, in the future, how might we design code that's best maintainable and is elegant?
Dialogue: 0,0:22:11.90,0:22:17.92,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们在思考 未来 我们如何才能设计出最易于维护和优雅的代码？

Dialogue: 0,0:22:27.53,0:22:34.82,英文,,0,0,0,,We want it to be simple, which means that if I showed someone the code, if someone else had to take over and maintain this for me, then they would be able to do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:27.53,0:22:34.82,中文,,0,0,0,,我们希望它是简单的 这意味着如果我向某人展示了代码 如果其他人必须接手并为我维护它 那么他们就能够做到

Dialogue: 0,0:31:19.10,0:31:21.48,英文,,0,0,0,,So a lot of databases have similar requirements.

Dialogue: 0,0:32:15.39,0:32:18.59,中文,,0,0,0,,所以现在我们正在尝试弄清楚 好吧 并非所有资源都可能有效
Dialogue: 0,0:32:18.59,0:32:22.61,英文,,0,0,0,,So if a user did not submit the necessary information, we're just not going to let you make the resource.

Dialogue: 0,0:32:51.90,0:32:57.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So that means that validation for a resource comes included, batteries included, out of the box.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:51.90,0:32:57.21,中文,,0,0,0,,这意味着资源的验证是包含在内的 开箱即用的
Dialogue: 0,0:32:57.21,0:33:07.14,英文,,0,0,0,,And so the idea is that without even knowing what a resource is, we can always call this validation function because we know that exists based on the interface that we have it.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:57.21,0:33:07.14,中文,,0,0,0,,所以想法是 即使不知道资源是什么 我们也可以始终调用此验证函数 因为我们知道它基于我们拥有的接口而存在
Dialogue: 0,0:33:07.14,0:33:09.60,英文,,0,0,0,,Great example is that any list can use the size method.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:07.14,0:33:09.60,中文,,0,0,0,,一个很好的例子是任何列表都可以使用 size 方法
Dialogue: 0,0:33:09.60,0:33:11.60,英文,,0,0,0,,It doesn't matter what sort of list you have.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:09.60,0:33:11.60,中文,,0,0,0,,你有什么样的清单都无所谓
Dialogue: 0,0:33:11.60,0:33:16.34,英文,,0,0,0,,They all have access to size by virtue of being a list.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:11.60,0:33:16.34,中文,,0,0,0,,由于它们都是列表 因此它们都可以访问 size
Dialogue: 0,0:33:16.34,0:33:19.78,英文,,0,0,0,,So the next idea that we want to implement is this thing called missing fields.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:16.34,0:33:19.78,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们想要实现的下一个想法是这个叫做缺失字段的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:33:19.78,0:33:24.22,英文,,0,0,0,,So if a user puts in credentials, we don't want to just say, hey, you can't make the resource.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:19.78,0:33:24.22,中文,,0,0,0,,因此 如果用户输入凭据 我们不想只是说 嘿 你不能创建资源
Dialogue: 0,0:33:24.22,0:33:25.54,英文,,0,0,0,,We want to say what you're missing.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:24.22,0:33:25.54,中文,,0,0,0,,我们想说你错过了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:33:25.54,0:33:28.97,英文,,0,0,0,,If you didn't put in the Google Sheets URL, the user should see a message saying,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:25.54,0:33:28.97,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你没有输入 Google Sheets URL 用户应该会看到一条消息 说
Dialogue: 0,0:33:28.97,0:33:32.97,英文,,0,0,0,,hey, you forgot to put in a Google Sheets URL, so we can't make this resource for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:28.97,0:33:32.97,中文,,0,0,0,,嘿 你忘记输入 Google Sheets URL 了 所以我们无法为你创建这个资源
Dialogue: 0,0:33:32.97,0:33:36.91,英文,,0,0,0,,Or maybe they're missing other details, like the name of the resource, their login information.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:32.97,0:33:36.91,中文,,0,0,0,,或者他们可能缺少其他详细信息 例如资源的名称、他们的登录信息
Dialogue: 0,0:33:36.91,0:33:39.90,英文,,0,0,0,,So we want to go and tell them those details.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:36.91,0:33:39.90,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们想去告诉他们这些细节
Dialogue: 0,0:33:39.90,0:33:45.43,英文,,0,0,0,,So my objective now is to add a way to track these missing fields and then incorporate validation for those fields.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:39.90,0:33:45.43,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我现在目标是添加一种方法来跟踪这些缺失的字段 然后将这些字段的验证合并进来
Dialogue: 0,0:33:45.43,0:33:51.45,英文,,0,0,0,,And that way, a user can be informed on what needs to change more than just telling them that, hey, it's not going to work.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:45.43,0:33:51.45,中文,,0,0,0,,这样一来 用户就可以被告知需要改变什么 而不仅仅是告诉他们 嘿 这行不通
Dialogue: 0,0:33:51.45,0:33:53.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So here's a question that we can answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:51.45,0:33:53.21,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这是一个我们可以回答的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:33:53.21,0:33:55.27,英文,,0,0,0,,How can we expand functionality to include this?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:53.21,0:33:55.27,中文,,0,0,0,,我们如何扩展功能以包含这一点？
Dialogue: 0,0:33:55.27,0:34:06.14,英文,,0,0,0,,And what would we need to change to implement missing fields into our system?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:55.27,0:34:06.14,中文,,0,0,0,,我们需要改变什么才能将缺失的字段实现到我们的系统中？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:06.14,0:34:11.08,英文,,0,0,0,,This is a question for you all, so if anyone wants to take a stab.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:06.14,0:34:11.08,中文,,0,0,0,,这是一个给你们大家的问题 所以如果有人想尝试一下
Dialogue: 0,0:34:11.08,0:34:12.77,英文,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:11.08,0:34:12.77,中文,,0,0,0,,是的
Dialogue: 0,0:34:12.77,0:34:14.33,英文,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:12.77,0:34:14.33,中文,,0,0,0,,对不起？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:14.33,0:34:15.07,英文,,0,0,0,,You can have fallbacks.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:14.33,0:34:15.07,中文,,0,0,0,,你可以有后备
Dialogue: 0,0:34:15.07,0:34:21.24,英文,,0,0,0,,What do you mean by fallbacks?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:15.07,0:34:21.24,中文,,0,0,0,,你说的后备是什么意思？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:21.24,0:34:22.32,英文,,0,0,0,,Yes, you can.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:21.24,0:34:22.32,中文,,0,0,0,,是的 你可以
Dialogue: 0,0:34:22.32,0:34:23.83,英文,,0,0,0,,That is.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:22.32,0:34:23.83,中文,,0,0,0,,那是
Dialogue: 0,0:34:23.83,0:34:25.95,英文,,0,0,0,,That's actually a good point.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:23.83,0:34:25.95,中文,,0,0,0,,这实际上是一个很好的观点
Dialogue: 0,0:34:25.95,0:34:27.01,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's actually very true.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:25.95,0:34:27.01,中文,,0,0,0,,是的 这实际上非常正确
Dialogue: 0,0:34:27.01,0:34:28.09,英文,,0,0,0,,So you can have defaults.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:27.01,0:34:28.09,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你可以有默认值
Dialogue: 0,0:34:28.09,0:34:32.34,英文,,0,0,0,,If a user doesn't give you information, you can show something to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:28.09,0:34:32.34,中文,,0,0,0,,如果用户没有提供信息 你可以向他们展示一些东西
Dialogue: 0,0:34:32.34,0:34:38.12,英文,,0,0,0,,One thing is that for this particular scenario, sometimes we'll run into issues where we don't know what the default is.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:32.34,0:34:38.12,中文,,0,0,0,,有一件事是 对于这种特殊情况 有时我们会遇到我们不知道默认值是什么的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:34:38.12,0:34:49.20,英文,,0,0,0,,If you're telling me access to Google Sheets, what do I put as the default?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:38.12,0:34:49.20,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你告诉我可以访问 Google Sheets 我应该将什么作为默认值？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:49.20,0:34:51.35,英文,,0,0,0,,But you have a lot of different Google Sheets, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:49.20,0:34:51.35,中文,,0,0,0,,但是你有很多不同的 Google Sheets 对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:51.35,0:34:52.63,英文,,0,0,0,,So you can't just have one for all of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:51.35,0:34:52.63,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你不能只为所有这些都有一个
Dialogue: 0,0:34:52.63,0:34:54.45,英文,,0,0,0,,You'd have one per different.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:52.63,0:34:54.45,中文,,0,0,0,,每个不同的都有一个
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.45,0:34:57.05,英文,,0,0,0,,So how do I deal with this idea of telling the user that it's missing?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.45,0:34:57.05,中文,,0,0,0,,那么我如何处理告诉用户它丢失的这个想法？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.05,0:34:57.79,英文,,0,0,0,,You want to take a stab?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.05,0:34:57.79,中文,,0,0,0,,你想尝试一下吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.79,0:34:58.49,英文,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.79,0:34:58.49,中文,,0,0,0,,是的
Dialogue: 0,0:34:58.49,0:34:59.07,英文,,0,0,0,,AUDIENCE 2 Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:58.49,0:34:59.07,中文,,0,0,0,,观众 2 是的
Dialogue: 0,0:34:59.07,0:35:08.35,英文,,0,0,0,,My guess is you add to your interface a function you can call that will return a construct or something with one field.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:59.07,0:35:08.35,中文,,0,0,0,,我的猜测是 你在你的接口中添加了一个可以调用的函数 它将返回一个带有 1 个字段的结构或其他东西
Dialogue: 0,0:35:08.35,0:35:09.82,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, no, that's exactly right.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:08.35,0:35:09.82,中文,,0,0,0,,是的 不 那完全正确
Dialogue: 0,0:35:09.82,0:35:10.94,英文,,0,0,0,,That's actually exactly what I did.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:09.82,0:35:10.94,中文,,0,0,0,,这实际上就是我所做的
Dialogue: 0,0:35:10.94,0:35:14.98,英文,,0,0,0,,So the solution was we rethought validation as passing a missing fields test.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:10.94,0:35:14.98,中文,,0,0,0,,所以解决方案是我们重新思考验证作为通过缺失字段测试
Dialogue: 0,0:35:14.98,0:35:21.00,英文,,0,0,0,,And the missing fields test was that we would return basically a struct of what the missing fields are.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:14.98,0:35:21.00,中文,,0,0,0,,缺失字段测试是我们基本上会返回一个关于哪些字段缺失的结构
Dialogue: 0,0:35:21.00,0:35:23.25,英文,,0,0,0,,So I give you a list of missing fields.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:21.00,0:35:23.25,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我给你一个缺失字段的列表
Dialogue: 0,0:35:23.25,0:35:25.01,英文,,0,0,0,,And that way, you know what's not there.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:23.25,0:35:25.01,中文,,0,0,0,,这样 你就知道那里有什么没有
Dialogue: 0,0:35:25.01,0:35:29.75,英文,,0,0,0,,And then we rethink validation as being that the list of missing fields should be empty.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:25.01,0:35:29.75,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我们将验证重新思考为缺失字段列表应该为空
Dialogue: 0,0:35:29.75,0:35:35.77,英文,,0,0,0,,And this matters because if we didn't rethink it, then we have a validation function and we have a missing fields function.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:29.75,0:35:35.77,中文,,0,0,0,,这很重要 因为如果我们不重新思考它 那么我们就有一个验证函数和一个缺失字段函数
Dialogue: 0,0:35:35.77,0:35:37.76,英文,,0,0,0,,But they both might be out of sync.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:35.77,0:35:37.76,中文,,0,0,0,,但它们都可能不同步
Dialogue: 0,0:35:37.76,0:35:40.46,英文,,0,0,0,,What happens if you see a missing field, but it's validated?
Dialogue: 0,0:35:37.76,0:35:40.46,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你看到一个缺失的字段 但它已经过验证 会发生什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:35:40.46,0:35:41.58,英文,,0,0,0,,That doesn't make sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:40.46,0:35:41.58,中文,,0,0,0,,这说不通
Dialogue: 0,0:35:41.58,0:35:45.26,英文,,0,0,0,,Why am I being told that it's missing if I can make the resource?
Dialogue: 0,0:35:41.58,0:35:45.26,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我可以创建资源 为什么还要告诉我它丢失了？
Dialogue: 0,0:35:45.26,0:35:46.88,英文,,0,0,0,,Or vice versa.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:45.26,0:35:46.88,中文,,0,0,0,,反之亦然
Dialogue: 0,0:35:46.88,0:35:50.04,英文,,0,0,0,,What if there are no missing fields, but I have to validate it?
Dialogue: 0,0:35:46.88,0:35:50.04,中文,,0,0,0,,如果没有缺失的字段 但我必须验证它怎么办？
Dialogue: 0,0:35:50.04,0:35:52.33,英文,,0,0,0,,Then I feel like it's a bug and something is going wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:50.04,0:35:52.33,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我觉得这是一个错误 出了问题
Dialogue: 0,0:35:52.33,0:35:56.27,英文,,0,0,0,,So we link the two together so we know that they're always going to be in sync.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:52.33,0:35:56.27,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们将两者联系在一起 这样我们就知道它们总是同步的
Dialogue: 0,0:35:56.27,0:35:59.01,英文,,0,0,0,,And so that way, we can synchronize between them.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:56.27,0:35:59.01,中文,,0,0,0,,这样 我们就可以在它们之间进行同步
Dialogue: 0,0:35:59.01,0:36:03.78,英文,,0,0,0,,So the missing fields equals validation, and validation equals missing fields.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:59.01,0:36:03.78,中文,,0,0,0,,所以缺失的字段等于验证 验证等于缺失的字段
Dialogue: 0,0:36:03.78,0:36:05.38,英文,,0,0,0,,We can also upgrade the fields.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:03.78,0:36:05.38,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还可以升级字段
Dialogue: 0,0:36:05.38,0:36:12.78,英文,,0,0,0,,So let's say later on that I say that every port number should be a number and that you can't try to put in a string or characters or exclamation marks or anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:05.38,0:36:12.78,中文,,0,0,0,,假设稍后我说每个端口号都应该是一个数字 并且你不能尝试输入字符串或字符或感叹号或任何东西
Dialogue: 0,0:36:12.78,0:36:18.75,英文,,0,0,0,,I just change it one time for the port number for the general database, and it changes it for every single kind of database.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:12.78,0:36:18.75,中文,,0,0,0,,我只为通用数据库的端口号更改一次 它就为每一种数据库更改一次
Dialogue: 0,0:36:18.75,0:36:19.49,英文,,0,0,0,,And this matters.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:18.75,0:36:19.49,中文,,0,0,0,,这很重要
Dialogue: 0,0:36:19.49,0:36:21.91,英文,,0,0,0,,The company had like 30 kinds of databases.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:19.49,0:36:21.91,中文,,0,0,0,,该公司有大约 30 种数据库
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.91,0:36:25.59,英文,,0,0,0,,So this one small change really saves time for what people are doing.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.91,0:36:25.59,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这个小小的改变真的为人们正在做的事情节省了时间
Dialogue: 0,0:36:25.59,0:36:30.35,英文,,0,0,0,,We update every single usage by upgrading this one field component.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:25.59,0:36:30.35,中文,,0,0,0,,我们通过升级这一个字段组件来更新每一个使用
Dialogue: 0,0:36:30.35,0:36:40.25,英文,,0,0,0,,An analogy here is that if I have some superclass and I change that, every single subclass that inherits from it gets the change functionality as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:30.35,0:36:40.25,中文,,0,0,0,,这里的一个类比是 如果我有一个超类并且我更改了它 那么每个继承自它的子类也会获得更改功能
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.25,0:36:42.99,英文,,0,0,0,,So one last part that I want to talk about here was testing.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.25,0:36:42.99,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我想在这里谈的最后一部分是测试
Dialogue: 0,0:36:42.99,0:36:44.05,英文,,0,0,0,,And testing matters.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:42.99,0:36:44.05,中文,,0,0,0,,测试很重要
Dialogue: 0,0:36:44.05,0:36:46.58,英文,,0,0,0,,I know that no one probably really likes testing.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:44.05,0:36:46.58,中文,,0,0,0,,我知道可能没有人真正喜欢测试
Dialogue: 0,0:36:46.58,0:36:47.36,英文,,0,0,0,,Can I get a show of hands?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:46.58,0:36:47.36,中文,,0,0,0,,我可以举手示意吗？

Dialogue: 0,0:36:48.28,0:36:50.04,英文,,0,0,0,,Like, you just love writing tests?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:48.28,0:36:50.04,中文,,0,0,0,,比如 你只是喜欢编写测试？
Dialogue: 0,0:36:50.04,0:36:51.34,英文,,0,0,0,,Yeah, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:50.04,0:36:51.34,中文,,0,0,0,,是的 就是这样
Dialogue: 0,0:36:51.34,0:36:54.32,英文,,0,0,0,,It's not something that anyone really enjoys.

Dialogue: 0,0:36:54.32,0:36:55.78,英文,,0,0,0,,But it does matter, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:54.32,0:36:55.78,中文,,0,0,0,,但这确实很重要 对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:36:55.78,0:36:58.13,英文,,0,0,0,,Because in the real world, we don't have an autograder.

Dialogue: 0,0:37:03.29,0:37:07.72,英文,,0,0,0,,So someone at the end of the day is writing tests in order to say that your code is correct.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:03.29,0:37:07.72,中文,,0,0,0,,所以最终总有人在编写测试 以便说你的代码是正确的
Dialogue: 0,0:37:07.72,0:37:10.84,英文,,0,0,0,,And so here, we're trying to figure out, would the right missing fields be displayed?
Dialogue: 0,0:37:07.72,0:37:10.84,中文,,0,0,0,,所以在这里 我们正在尝试弄清楚 是否会显示正确的缺失字段？

Dialogue: 0,0:37:34.82,0:37:42.50,中文,,0,0,0,,为此 我构建了一个实用程序 可以测试输入和输出的每种可能组合 但我将其设计用于通用数据库
Dialogue: 0,0:37:42.50,0:37:49.50,英文,,0,0,0,,So the idea of patterning the resource, if every resource is going to follow that, then I've just hit 30 resources in testing just with one thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:42.50,0:37:49.50,中文,,0,0,0,,所以对资源进行模式化的想法 如果每个资源都将遵循该模式 那么我只需测试一件事就可以测试 30 个资源

Dialogue: 0,0:39:04.71,0:39:11.68,英文,,0,0,0,,And so the idea of this one is to motivate this idea that what you're learning about actually is useful and does matter in the real world.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:04.71,0:39:11.68,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这个项目的想法是为了激发这样一个想法：你正在学习的东西实际上是有用的 并且在现实世界中确实很重要

Dialogue: 0,0:39:38.53,0:39:42.41,英文,,0,0,0,,So the problem is that we don't allow every single update to go to your phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:38.53,0:39:42.41,中文,,0,0,0,,问题是 我们不允许每一个更新都发送到你的手机上
Dialogue: 0,0:39:42.41,0:39:45.39,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you think about your phone, your phone probably gets an update like what?
Dialogue: 0,0:39:42.41,0:39:45.39,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你想想你的手机 你的手机可能多久更新一次？
Dialogue: 0,0:39:45.39,0:39:47.15,英文,,0,0,0,,Like once every few months.

Dialogue: 0,0:39:48.46,0:39:52.12,中文,,0,0,0,,也许你偶尔会为一些小的安全问题更新
Dialogue: 0,0:39:52.12,0:39:55.38,英文,,0,0,0,,But the idea is that we only release new versions in a cycle.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:52.12,0:39:55.38,中文,,0,0,0,,但我们的想法是 我们只在一个周期内发布新版本
Dialogue: 0,0:39:55.38,0:39:57.14,英文,,0,0,0,,And we have very minor changes in between.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:55.38,0:39:57.14,中文,,0,0,0,,并且我们在两者之间进行非常小的更改
Dialogue: 0,0:39:57.14,0:40:04.01,英文,,0,0,0,,But every single year, we know Apple is going to release a new version of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, all these various things.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:57.14,0:40:04.01,中文,,0,0,0,,但每年 我们都知道 Apple 会发布新版本的 iOS、macOS、iPadOS 等各种版本
Dialogue: 0,0:40:04.01,0:40:04.99,英文,,0,0,0,,Think about grade scope.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:04.01,0:40:04.99,中文,,0,0,0,,想想 GradeScope(全局作用域)
Dialogue: 0,0:40:04.99,0:40:06.22,英文,,0,0,0,,Grade scope does the same.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:04.99,0:40:06.22,中文,,0,0,0,,GradeScope 也是一样
Dialogue: 0,0:40:06.22,0:40:08.22,英文,,0,0,0,,It only takes a small number of submissions.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:06.22,0:40:08.22,中文,,0,0,0,,它只接受少量的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:40:08.22,0:40:09.92,英文,,0,0,0,,You might be working on more changes locally.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:08.22,0:40:09.92,中文,,0,0,0,,你可能在本地进行更多的更改
Dialogue: 0,0:40:09.92,0:40:11.56,英文,,0,0,0,,You might be making more commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:09.92,0:40:11.56,中文,,0,0,0,,你可能在进行更多的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:40:11.56,0:40:13.54,英文,,0,0,0,,But you can't be pushing every single one of those.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:11.56,0:40:13.54,中文,,0,0,0,,但你不能推送每一个
Dialogue: 0,0:40:13.54,0:40:19.30,英文,,0,0,0,,So grade scope, in that case, is enforcing it, whereas in the first example, you were enforcing it on Apple and Google.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:13.54,0:40:19.30,中文,,0,0,0,,所以在这种情况下 GradeScope 在强制执行它 而在第一个例子中 你是在 Apple 和 Google 上强制执行它
Dialogue: 0,0:40:19.30,0:40:23.63,英文,,0,0,0,,And so the key idea is that they don't release every single time you make a new commit internally.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:19.30,0:40:23.63,中文,,0,0,0,,所以关键的想法是 他们不会在你每次在内部进行新的提交时都发布
Dialogue: 0,0:40:23.63,0:40:30.61,英文,,0,0,0,,So if a developer pushes some code, even if it goes into their main code base, you don't just give it out to all of the users.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:23.63,0:40:30.61,中文,,0,0,0,,所以如果一个开发者推送了一些代码 即使它进入了他们的主代码库 你也不会把它直接分发给所有用户
Dialogue: 0,0:40:30.61,0:40:38.51,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you look over here, even if you're like, oh, automatically download iOS updates and prepare for installation, it doesn't happen all the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:30.61,0:40:38.51,中文,,0,0,0,,所以如果你看看这里 即使你像“自动下载 iOS 更新并准备安装”一样 它也不会一直发生
Dialogue: 0,0:40:38.51,0:40:40.47,英文,,0,0,0,,So that's the initial setup for the problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:38.51,0:40:40.47,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是这个问题的初始设置
Dialogue: 0,0:40:40.47,0:40:42.79,英文,,0,0,0,,Now let's say some constraints on how we're doing this.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:40.47,0:40:42.79,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我们说一些关于我们如何做这件事的限制
Dialogue: 0,0:40:42.79,0:40:46.51,英文,,0,0,0,,So for simplicity, let's just treat every change like a Git commit.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:42.79,0:40:46.51,中文,,0,0,0,,为了简单起见 让我们把每一次更改都视为一次 Git 提交
Dialogue: 0,0:40:46.51,0:40:49.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So commits are snapshots of your code at a moment in time.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:46.51,0:40:49.21,中文,,0,0,0,,所以提交是你代码在某个时间点的快照
Dialogue: 0,0:40:49.21,0:40:53.82,英文,,0,0,0,,And so we can use the commits to store the differences in your code as you make changes.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:49.21,0:40:53.82,中文,,0,0,0,,因此 我们可以使用提交来存储你在进行更改时代码中的差异
Dialogue: 0,0:40:53.82,0:40:58.10,英文,,0,0,0,,So this is the same commit that you push whenever you finish a lab, when you finish a project.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:53.82,0:40:58.10,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这是你在完成实验、完成项目时推送的相同提交
Dialogue: 0,0:40:58.10,0:41:02.16,英文,,0,0,0,,You're pushing it to your GitHub repository and then synchronizing with GitHub.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:58.10,0:41:02.16,中文,,0,0,0,,你正在将其推送到你的 GitHub 存储库 然后与 GitHub 同步
Dialogue: 0,0:41:02.16,0:41:05.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Versions refer to the most recent Git commits on a given branch.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:02.16,0:41:05.76,中文,,0,0,0,,版本是指给定分支上最新的 Git 提交
Dialogue: 0,0:41:05.76,0:41:09.90,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's say you also have easy access to all the git commits, so we don't have to worry about getting access to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:05.76,0:41:09.90,中文,,0,0,0,,假设你还可以轻松访问所有 git 提交 所以我们不必担心如何访问它们
Dialogue: 0,0:41:09.90,0:41:12.92,英文,,0,0,0,,We can load them onto your computer in a reasonable amount of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:09.90,0:41:12.92,中文,,0,0,0,,我们可以在合理的时间内将它们加载到你的计算机上
Dialogue: 0,0:41:12.92,0:41:14.34,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's say that we have a lot of commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:12.92,0:41:14.34,中文,,0,0,0,,假设我们有很多提交
Dialogue: 0,0:41:14.34,0:41:19.46,英文,,0,0,0,,So you can't just store for a given deployment, for a given release, every single commit that's included in it.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:14.34,0:41:19.46,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你不能仅仅为了一个给定的部署 一个给定的版本 就存储其中包含的每一个提交
Dialogue: 0,0:41:19.46,0:41:21.88,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's say that that's infeasible for now.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:19.46,0:41:21.88,中文,,0,0,0,,假设现在这是不可行的
Dialogue: 0,0:41:21.88,0:41:26.17,英文,,0,0,0,,And let's also say that once a change is made, we don't undo or modify that change.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:21.88,0:41:26.17,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还假设 一旦进行了更改 我们就不会撤消或修改该更改
Dialogue: 0,0:41:26.17,0:41:30.27,英文,,0,0,0,,So in reality, someone might come along and change that part of the code later on.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:26.17,0:41:30.27,中文,,0,0,0,,所以在现实中 可能会有人来稍后更改代码的那部分
Dialogue: 0,0:41:30.27,0:41:34.26,英文,,0,0,0,,But we can use something called git blame,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:30.27,0:41:34.26,中文,,0,0,0,,但我们可以使用一个名为 git blame 的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:41:34.26,0:41:41.26,英文,,0,0,0,,which tells us what GitHub username went in and changed that line of code in the future, if we actually wanted to implement this and get around that.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:34.26,0:41:41.26,中文,,0,0,0,,它告诉我们将来哪个 GitHub 用户名进入并更改了那行代码 如果我们真的想实现它并解决这个问题的话
Dialogue: 0,0:41:41.26,0:41:45.63,英文,,0,0,0,,The last and really important assumption that we have to make for
Dialogue: 0,0:41:41.26,0:41:45.63,中文,,0,0,0,,最后一个也是非常重要的假设 我们必须做出这个假设
Dialogue: 0,0:41:45.63,0:41:50.63,英文,,0,0,0,,why this is even a problem at all is that we assume that manually splitting the commits for inclusion,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:45.63,0:41:50.63,中文,,0,0,0,,我们假设手动拆分提交以决定哪些提交应该包含在发布版本中是非常困难的 也就是说
Dialogue: 0,0:41:50.63,0:41:55.63,英文,,0,0,0,,so figuring out is one commit in the release, is one commit not in the release, like it came after that version, is really hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:50.63,0:41:55.63,中文,,0,0,0,,判断一个提交是否应该包含在发布版本中 比如是否来自于该版本之后的提交 这是一件很困难的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:41:55.63,0:42:04.10,英文,,0,0,0,,And when I say really hard, it's not like we have dozens of commits, or when you all are working on projects, probably singles of commits, like maybe three.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:55.63,0:42:04.10,中文,,0,0,0,,当我说“真的很难”时 并不是说我们有几十个提交 或者当你们都在做项目时 可能只有几个提交 比如三个
Dialogue: 0,0:42:04.10,0:42:06.15,英文,,0,0,0,,We have millions or billions of commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:04.10,0:42:06.15,中文,,0,0,0,,我们有数百万或数十亿个提交
Dialogue: 0,0:42:06.15,0:42:06.79,英文,,0,0,0,,And these are a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:06.15,0:42:06.79,中文,,0,0,0,,这些太多了
Dialogue: 0,0:42:06.79,0:42:08.61,英文,,0,0,0,,There's no way that anybody could look at these.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:06.79,0:42:08.61,中文,,0,0,0,,任何人都不可能查看这些
Dialogue: 0,0:42:08.61,0:42:11.46,英文,,0,0,0,,Even if you had a team of people, they're probably still not going to be able to look at it.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:08.61,0:42:11.46,中文,,0,0,0,,即使你有一个团队 他们可能仍然无法查看它
Dialogue: 0,0:42:11.46,0:42:16.10,英文,,0,0,0,,So we basically kind of have to have some sort of code-based solution.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:11.46,0:42:16.10,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们基本上必须有某种基于代码的解决方案
Dialogue: 0,0:42:16.10,0:42:21.10,英文,,0,0,0,,Now we're going to introduce an idea that might be interesting, is thinking about Git as a graph.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:16.10,0:42:21.10,中文,,0,0,0,,现在我们将介绍一个可能很有趣的想法 就是将 Git 视为一个图
Dialogue: 0,0:42:21.10,0:42:25.56,英文,,0,0,0,,And so maybe you saw this earlier in the Git lab, where we drew out this graph idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:21.10,0:42:25.56,中文,,0,0,0,,也许你在之前的 Git 实验中看到过这个 我们画出了这个图的想法
Dialogue: 0,0:42:25.56,0:42:29.84,英文,,0,0,0,,But the idea is that going from the left to the right, we have this time of commit.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:25.56,0:42:29.84,中文,,0,0,0,,但想法是 从左到右 我们有这个提交时间
Dialogue: 0,0:42:29.84,0:42:33.28,英文,,0,0,0,,So the commits that are more on the right come after.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:29.84,0:42:33.28,中文,,0,0,0,,所以更靠右的提交是在之后进行的
Dialogue: 0,0:42:33.28,0:42:37.67,英文,,0,0,0,,Every single commit has a parent of some sort, potentially two if it is a merge commit.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:33.28,0:42:37.67,中文,,0,0,0,,每个提交都有某种父级 如果是合并提交 则可能有两个
Dialogue: 0,0:42:37.67,0:42:40.87,英文,,0,0,0,,So each vertex inside of our graph is a commit.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:37.67,0:42:40.87,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们图中的每个顶点都是一个提交
Dialogue: 0,0:42:40.87,0:42:43.33,英文,,0,0,0,,And then each edge is directed.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:40.87,0:42:43.33,中文,,0,0,0,,然后每条边都是有向的
Dialogue: 0,0:42:43.33,0:42:44.83,英文,,0,0,0,,From the commit to its parent.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:43.33,0:42:44.83,中文,,0,0,0,,从提交到其父级
Dialogue: 0,0:42:44.83,0:42:51.01,英文,,0,0,0,,So these are unweighted edges, because we aren't assigning any weight between a commit and its parent.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:44.83,0:42:51.01,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这些是未加权的边 因为我们没有在提交与其父级之间分配任何权重
Dialogue: 0,0:42:51.01,0:42:55.79,英文,,0,0,0,,If you were just the parent, there is no more parent or less parent than anyone else.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:51.01,0:42:55.79,中文,,0,0,0,,如果你只是父级 那么没有比其他任何人更多或更少的父级
Dialogue: 0,0:42:55.79,0:42:57.27,英文,,0,0,0,,And commits store their parents.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:55.79,0:42:57.27,中文,,0,0,0,,并且提交存储它们的父级
Dialogue: 0,0:42:57.27,0:43:04.18,英文,,0,0,0,,Since upon creation, a commit only knows its parents, but it does not know who's going to come from it in the future as children.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:57.27,0:43:04.18,中文,,0,0,0,,因为在创建时 提交只知道它的父级 但它不知道将来谁会作为子级来自它
Dialogue: 0,0:43:04.18,0:43:13.66,英文,,0,0,0,,So if I'm making f, I don't know what other commits are going to descend from f in the future, but I know that f is a merge commit between e and c.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:04.18,0:43:13.66,中文,,0,0,0,,所以如果我正在制作 F 我不知道将来还有什么其他提交会从 F 中衍生出来 但我知道 F 是 E 和 C 之间的合并提交
Dialogue: 0,0:43:13.66,0:43:15.54,英文,,0,0,0,,Now let's take this as an example.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:13.66,0:43:15.54,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我们以这个为例
Dialogue: 0,0:43:15.54,0:43:20.05,英文,,0,0,0,,And now let's factor in what we said at the very beginning, that not every single commit is deployed to the user.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:15.54,0:43:20.05,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我们考虑一下我们在一开始所说的 并不是每个提交都部署给用户
Dialogue: 0,0:43:20.05,0:43:23.01,英文,,0,0,0,,Let's say that the green commits are deployed commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:20.05,0:43:23.01,中文,,0,0,0,,假设绿色的提交是已部署的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:43:23.01,0:43:30.35,英文,,0,0,0,,And I make some change in commit C. And I ask this question, which releases contain my change?
Dialogue: 0,0:43:23.01,0:43:30.35,中文,,0,0,0,,我在提交 C 中做了一些更改 我问这个问题 哪些版本包含我的更改？
Dialogue: 0,0:43:30.35,0:43:39.42,英文,,0,0,0,,Can anyone help me out in figuring which of the green commits here contain the change in C?
Dialogue: 0,0:43:30.35,0:43:39.42,中文,,0,0,0,,谁能帮我弄清楚这里的哪些绿色提交包含了 C 中的更改？
Dialogue: 0,0:43:39.42,0:43:47.90,英文,,0,0,0,,I promise you, there is no trick to this question.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:39.42,0:43:47.90,中文,,0,0,0,,我向你保证 这个问题没有技巧
Dialogue: 0,0:43:47.90,0:43:49.22,英文,,0,0,0,,Anyone want to take a stab?
Dialogue: 0,0:43:47.90,0:43:49.22,中文,,0,0,0,,有人想尝试一下吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:43:49.22,0:43:52.23,英文,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:49.22,0:43:52.23,中文,,0,0,0,,是的
Dialogue: 0,0:43:52.23,0:44:00.05,英文,,0,0,0,,D, E, F, G. You're very close.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:52.23,0:44:00.05,中文,,0,0,0,,D、E、F、G 你很接近了
Dialogue: 0,0:44:00.05,0:44:04.13,英文,,0,0,0,,So E and F are both not deployed commits, because they're not green commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:00.05,0:44:04.13,中文,,0,0,0,,所以 E 和 F 都不是已部署的提交 因为它们不是绿色的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:44:04.13,0:44:06.25,英文,,0,0,0,,So we ignore them.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:04.13,0:44:06.25,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们忽略它们
Dialogue: 0,0:44:06.25,0:44:11.62,英文,,0,0,0,,It's D and G, and it's also C, because C itself is a deployed commit.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:06.25,0:44:11.62,中文,,0,0,0,,是 D 和 G 也是 C 因为 C 本身就是一个已部署的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:44:11.62,0:44:12.42,英文,,0,0,0,,But you had the right idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:11.62,0:44:12.42,中文,,0,0,0,,但你的想法是对的
Dialogue: 0,0:44:12.42,0:44:25.85,英文,,0,0,0,,How did you figure out that it was those four commits to look at?
Dialogue: 0,0:44:12.42,0:44:25.85,中文,,0,0,0,,你是如何确定要查看这四个提交的？
Dialogue: 0,0:44:25.85,0:44:26.63,英文,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:25.85,0:44:26.63,中文,,0,0,0,,没错
Dialogue: 0,0:44:26.63,0:44:33.23,英文,,0,0,0,,So the algorithm was that we started at C. We saw who was descended from it, which commits had C as its parent.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:26.63,0:44:33.23,中文,,0,0,0,,所以算法是我们从 C 开始 我们看到了谁是它的后代 哪些提交以 C 作为其父级
Dialogue: 0,0:44:33.23,0:44:35.00,英文,,0,0,0,,And then we worked our way backwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:33.23,0:44:35.00,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我们一路往回走
Dialogue: 0,0:44:35.00,0:44:40.28,英文,,0,0,0,,And so we did a search from C. We found D, E, F, and G. Exactly right.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:35.00,0:44:40.28,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们从C开始搜索 找到了D、E、F和G 完全正确
Dialogue: 0,0:44:40.28,0:44:47.21,英文,,0,0,0,,So if you want to follow that out, we started from C. We go backwards to D and F.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:40.28,0:44:47.21,中文,,0,0,0,,顺着这条线 我们从C开始 回溯到D和F 然后碰到E和G
Dialogue: 0,0:44:47.21,0:44:54.21,英文,,0,0,0,, Then we go and hit E and G. So if I ask you which deployed commits, it's just C, D, and G, because we're trying to see which ones are green.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:47.21,0:44:54.21,中文,,0,0,0,,所以如果我问你哪些提交被部署了 答案是C、D和G 因为我们想看看哪些是绿色的
Dialogue: 0,0:44:54.21,0:44:56.73,英文,,0,0,0,,Now let's see an approach to solving this question.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:54.21,0:44:56.73,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我们看看解决这个问题的方法
Dialogue: 0,0:44:56.73,0:44:58.14,英文,,0,0,0,,So maybe there's two approaches.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:56.73,0:44:58.14,中文,,0,0,0,,可能会有两种方法
Dialogue: 0,0:44:58.14,0:45:00.68,英文,,0,0,0,,We'll start with the one that we just talked about.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:58.14,0:45:00.68,中文,,0,0,0,,我们先从刚才讨论的那个开始
Dialogue: 0,0:45:00.68,0:45:01.84,英文,,0,0,0,,We work backwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:00.68,0:45:01.84,中文,,0,0,0,,我们向前回溯
Dialogue: 0,0:45:01.84,0:45:04.54,英文,,0,0,0,,We look at commits storing parents.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:01.84,0:45:04.54,中文,,0,0,0,,我们查看存储父节点的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:45:04.54,0:45:06.81,英文,,0,0,0,,And Git is designed to tell us parents of commits through Git logs.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:04.54,0:45:06.81,中文,,0,0,0,,Git 的设计就是通过 `Git logs` 告诉我们提交的父节点
Dialogue: 0,0:45:06.81,0:45:09.47,英文,,0,0,0,,So maybe this is a little bit challenging to think about.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:06.81,0:45:09.47,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这可能有点难思考
Dialogue: 0,0:45:09.47,0:45:10.73,英文,,0,0,0,,But this is what we did previously.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:09.47,0:45:10.73,中文,,0,0,0,,但这就是我们之前做的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:45:10.73,0:45:12.01,英文,,0,0,0,,So this is what we just did.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:10.73,0:45:12.01,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是我们刚刚做的
Dialogue: 0,0:45:12.01,0:45:13.48,英文,,0,0,0,,This is how it would work.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:12.01,0:45:13.48,中文,,0,0,0,,这就是它的工作原理
Dialogue: 0,0:45:13.48,0:45:16.72,英文,,0,0,0,,Another option is to work in the direction that Git tells us.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:13.48,0:45:16.72,中文,,0,0,0,,另一个选择是按照 Git 告诉我们的方向工作
Dialogue: 0,0:45:16.72,0:45:23.28,英文,,0,0,0,,Maybe I take a look at commits and I see who the parent of that commit is instead of trying to figure out who the child of that commit is.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:16.72,0:45:23.28,中文,,0,0,0,,也许我会查看提交 看看那个提交的父节点是谁 而不是试图找出那个提交的子节点是谁
Dialogue: 0,0:45:23.28,0:45:29.95,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, this is a little annoying because now we have to grab every single ending commit, all the commits on the right-hand side, and then work our way left
Dialogue: 0,0:45:23.28,0:45:29.95,中文,,0,0,0,,现在 这有点烦人 因为我们必须抓住每一个结束提交 也就是右侧的所有提交 然后向左移动
Dialogue: 0,0:45:29.95,0:45:37.95,英文,,0,0,0,,until we hit the change that we're looking for at commit C. And if we don't hit the change, we can only terminate once we work backwards and we have to check timestamps.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:29.95,0:45:37.95,中文,,0,0,0,,直到我们找到我们在提交 C 处寻找的更改 如果我们没有找到更改 我们只能在回溯到最后并检查时间戳后才能终止
Dialogue: 0,0:45:37.95,0:45:44.39,英文,,0,0,0,,And it becomes a little annoying because we don't want to go all the way back to the very first commit, but we do need to stop eventually.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:37.95,0:45:44.39,中文,,0,0,0,,这有点烦人 因为我们不想一直回到最初的提交 但我们确实需要最终停下来
Dialogue: 0,0:45:44.39,0:45:46.11,英文,,0,0,0,,Here's an example of what that means.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:44.39,0:45:46.11,中文,,0,0,0,,这里有一个例子来说明这意味着什么
Dialogue: 0,0:45:46.11,0:45:56.53,英文,,0,0,0,,I start over here on the right-hand side, and I push all the way until I stop at C. And then once I stop at C, then I know, have I hit anybody that has C as its parent?
Dialogue: 0,0:45:46.11,0:45:56.53,中文,,0,0,0,,我从右侧开始 一直推到 C 停止 一旦我在 C 停止 我就知道了 我有没有碰到过任何以 C 为父节点？
Dialogue: 0,0:45:56.53,0:45:57.55,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, the answer is yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:56.53,0:45:57.55,中文,,0,0,0,,嗯 答案是肯定的
Dialogue: 0,0:45:57.55,0:46:06.46,英文,,0,0,0,,I start at H. H takes us to B, which is before C. So I know that B can't contain the change in C. It's not possible to contain a change that's coming in the future.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:57.55,0:46:06.46,中文,,0,0,0,,我从 H 开始 H 把我们带到 B B 在 C 之前 所以我知道 B 不能包含 C 中的更改 包含未来才会出现的更改是不可能的
Dialogue: 0,0:46:06.46,0:46:13.24,英文,,0,0,0,,Then I hit G. G goes backward to E to D. And then I realize that G and D are both descended from C. So that works.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:06.46,0:46:13.24,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我碰到 G G 向后到 E 到 D 然后我意识到 G 和 D 都是 C 的后代 所以这行得通
Dialogue: 0,0:46:13.24,0:46:16.76,英文,,0,0,0,,Then I hit F. F is OK, but F isn't a deployed commit.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:13.24,0:46:16.76,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我碰到 F F 没问题 但 F 不是一个已部署的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:46:16.76,0:46:17.68,英文,,0,0,0,,But I keep going.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:16.76,0:46:17.68,中文,,0,0,0,,但我继续前进
Dialogue: 0,0:46:17.68,0:46:20.26,英文,,0,0,0,,I see the E, D, C route and the C route.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:17.68,0:46:20.26,中文,,0,0,0,,我看到了 E、D、C 路线和 C 路线
Dialogue: 0,0:46:20.26,0:46:25.02,英文,,0,0,0,,I do the same for E. I do the same for D. That should feel a lot more complicated.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:20.26,0:46:25.02,中文,,0,0,0,,我对 E 也做同样的处理 对 D 也做同样的处理 这应该会让人觉得复杂得多
Dialogue: 0,0:46:25.02,0:46:28.71,英文,,0,0,0,,Something should feel weird about that solution compared to the first one.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:25.02,0:46:28.71,中文,,0,0,0,,与第一个解决方案相比 这个解决方案应该会让你觉得有些奇怪
Dialogue: 0,0:46:28.71,0:46:32.43,英文,,0,0,0,,You should innately just be like, wait, that seems like a very awkward way of doing this.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:28.71,0:46:32.43,中文,,0,0,0,,你应该本能地觉得 等等 这似乎是一种非常笨拙的做事方式
Dialogue: 0,0:46:32.43,0:46:34.29,英文,,0,0,0,,And you're actually right.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:32.43,0:46:34.29,中文,,0,0,0,,你说的没错
Dialogue: 0,0:46:34.29,0:46:35.91,英文,,0,0,0,,The idea here is that
Dialogue: 0,0:46:34.29,0:46:35.91,中文,,0,0,0,,这里的想法是
Dialogue: 0,0:46:35.91,0:46:44.08,英文,,0,0,0,,If we had, let's say, even more branches, even more commits going all over the place, this becomes really complicated, really challenging, and really annoying to deal with.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:35.91,0:46:44.08,中文,,0,0,0,,如果我们有 比如说 更多的分支 更多的提交到处都是 这就会变得非常复杂 非常具有挑战性 而且非常令人讨厌
Dialogue: 0,0:46:44.08,0:46:48.35,英文,,0,0,0,,Imagine trying to fix a bug with this method of doing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:44.08,0:46:48.35,中文,,0,0,0,,想象一下 用这种方法来修复一个 bug
Dialogue: 0,0:46:48.35,0:46:53.60,英文,,0,0,0,,So perhaps what we can do is we can deal with that earlier challenging part that I talked about,
Dialogue: 0,0:46:48.35,0:46:53.60,中文,,0,0,0,,所以也许我们可以做的是 我们可以处理我之前谈到的那个更具挑战性的部分
Dialogue: 0,0:46:53.60,0:46:58.60,英文,,0,0,0,,which is that Git is designed to tell us who the parent is, not the child is, because you can't tell the future.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:53.60,0:46:58.60,中文,,0,0,0,,那就是 Git 的设计目的是告诉我们谁是父节点 而不是子节点 因为你无法预测未来
Dialogue: 0,0:46:58.60,0:47:02.19,英文,,0,0,0,,And what we do is we normally think about Git in a commit-parent relationship.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:58.60,0:47:02.19,中文,,0,0,0,,我们通常认为 Git 是一种提交-父节点关系
Dialogue: 0,0:47:02.19,0:47:06.85,英文,,0,0,0,,So here's an example of a Git log that I did last semester when I QA'd Project 1C.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:02.19,0:47:06.85,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这里有一个 Git 日志的例子 是我上学期在做 Project 1C 的 QA 时做的
Dialogue: 0,0:47:06.85,0:47:13.34,英文,,0,0,0,,So you see that you have on the left-hand side the commit of the actual commit, and on the right-hand side is the commit ID of your parents.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:06.85,0:47:13.34,中文,,0,0,0,,所以你可以看到 在左侧是实际提交的提交 在右侧是你父节点的提交 ID
Dialogue: 0,0:47:13.34,0:47:15.00,英文,,0,0,0,,But what if we reversed it?
Dialogue: 0,0:47:13.34,0:47:15.00,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果我们把它颠倒过来呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:47:15.00,0:47:20.90,英文,,0,0,0,,So what if I created some mapping, and I mapped every single parent to the commit?
Dialogue: 0,0:47:15.00,0:47:20.90,中文,,0,0,0,,所以 如果我创建一些映射 并将每个父节点都映射到提交上会怎样？
Dialogue: 0,0:47:20.90,0:47:23.49,英文,,0,0,0,,So I reversed the order of all the edges.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:20.90,0:47:23.49,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我把所有边的顺序都颠倒了
Dialogue: 0,0:47:23.49,0:47:29.99,英文,,0,0,0,,And then we do what was mentioned earlier, and we do a BFS from that commit forward in time to find deployments that contain it.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:23.49,0:47:29.99,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我们做前面提到的 我们从那个提交开始向前进行 BFS 以找到包含它的部署
Dialogue: 0,0:47:29.99,0:47:33.27,英文,,0,0,0,,So it sounds a little weird, but we're not trying to find children that don't exist.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:29.99,0:47:33.27,中文,,0,0,0,,所以这听起来有点奇怪 但我们并不是想找到不存在的子节点
Dialogue: 0,0:47:33.27,0:47:38.06,英文,,0,0,0,,We're just trying to say, if you already do exist, just flip the ordering around.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:33.27,0:47:38.06,中文,,0,0,0,,我们只是想说 如果你已经存在 那就把顺序颠倒一下
Dialogue: 0,0:47:38.06,0:47:44.99,英文,,0,0,0,,And we'll use an adjacency list because technically for a commit, you can just store instance variables of how the commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:38.06,0:47:44.99,中文,,0,0,0,,我们将使用一个邻接表 因为从技术上讲 对于一个提交 你只需要存储提交的实例变量
Dialogue: 0,0:47:44.99,0:47:49.71,英文,,0,0,0,,You could just store commit one parent and potentially a merge commit, a second parent.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:44.99,0:47:49.71,中文,,0,0,0,,你只需要存储提交的一个父节点 以及可能的一个合并提交 一个第二个父节点
Dialogue: 0,0:47:49.71,0:47:52.71,英文,,0,0,0,,But if you have children, well, you could have infinite children.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:49.71,0:47:52.71,中文,,0,0,0,,但如果你有孩子 那么你可能有无数个孩子
Dialogue: 0,0:47:52.71,0:47:58.90,英文,,0,0,0,,And so we generalize that idea with just one big list, and we store everybody in that.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:52.71,0:47:58.90,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们用一个大的列表来概括这个想法 我们将每个人都存储在其中
Dialogue: 0,0:47:58.90,0:48:04.00,英文,,0,0,0,,Now let's talk about the solution very formally, just one slide explaining how it works.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:58.90,0:48:04.00,中文,,0,0,0,,现在让我们非常正式地讨论一下解决方案 只需一张幻灯片来解释它是如何工作的
Dialogue: 0,0:48:04.00,0:48:06.29,英文,,0,0,0,,So we can include a lot more optimizations and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:04.00,0:48:06.29,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们可以包含更多的优化和类似的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:48:06.29,0:48:08.27,英文,,0,0,0,,But here's the gist of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:06.29,0:48:08.27,中文,,0,0,0,,但这就是要点
Dialogue: 0,0:48:08.27,0:48:11.09,英文,,0,0,0,,The very first part is we build this Git commit graph.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:08.27,0:48:11.09,中文,,0,0,0,,第一部分是我们构建这个 Git 提交图
Dialogue: 0,0:48:11.09,0:48:14.51,英文,,0,0,0,,We store mappings from commits to their children.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:11.09,0:48:14.51,中文,,0,0,0,,我们将提交映射到它们的子节点
Dialogue: 0,0:48:14.51,0:48:16.37,英文,,0,0,0,,And then we generate a set of the deployed commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:14.51,0:48:16.37,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我们生成一组已部署的提交
Dialogue: 0,0:48:16.37,0:48:17.43,英文,,0,0,0,,This is separate from the graph.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:16.37,0:48:17.43,中文,,0,0,0,,这与图是分开的
Dialogue: 0,0:48:17.43,0:48:20.83,英文,,0,0,0,,Think about this as which nodes are marked in green.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:17.43,0:48:20.83,中文,,0,0,0,,把它想象成哪些节点被标记为绿色
Dialogue: 0,0:48:20.83,0:48:27.34,英文,,0,0,0,,Why might I want to use a set for this instead of a list?
Dialogue: 0,0:48:20.83,0:48:27.34,中文,,0,0,0,,为什么我可能想为此使用集合而不是列表？
Dialogue: 0,0:48:27.34,0:48:29.30,英文,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,0:48:27.34,0:48:29.30,中文,,0,0,0,,有吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:48:29.30,0:48:30.68,英文,,0,0,0,,No duplicates, exactly, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:48:29.30,0:48:30.68,中文,,0,0,0,,没有重复 完全正确
Dialogue: 0,0:48:30.68,0:48:34.94,英文,,0,0,0,,Because we don't care about the duplicateness and also the runtime, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:48:30.68,0:48:34.94,中文,,0,0,0,,因为我们不关心重复性 也不关心运行时间 对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:48:34.94,0:48:37.54,英文,,0,0,0,,Because we don't care about the ordering of the list, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:48:34.94,0:48:37.54,中文,,0,0,0,,因为我们不关心列表的顺序 对吧？
Dialogue: 0,0:48:37.54,0:48:40.47,英文,,0,0,0,,Lists are ordered collections, ordered sequences.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:37.54,0:48:40.47,中文,,0,0,0,,列表是有序集合 有序序列
Dialogue: 0,0:48:40.47,0:48:47.39,英文,,0,0,0,,And we don't actually care that some commit is earlier via timestamps compared to a later one later in the list.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:40.47,0:48:47.39,中文,,0,0,0,,我们实际上并不关心某个提交通过时间戳与列表中后面的提交相比更早
Dialogue: 0,0:48:47.39,0:48:53.80,英文,,0,0,0,,So a set just gives us access to this easy runtime of just constant time amortized if we just use a hash set.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:47.39,0:48:53.80,中文,,0,0,0,,所以一个集合只是让我们能够轻松地以常数时间摊销的方式访问 如果我们只使用一个哈希集合的话
Dialogue: 0,0:48:53.80,0:48:55.20,英文,,0,0,0,,And then we do a BFS.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:53.80,0:48:55.20,中文,,0,0,0,,然后我们进行 BFS
Dialogue: 0,0:48:55.20,0:48:59.44,英文,,0,0,0,,We look at the input commit, and then we check if commits traversed are in the deployed commits.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:55.20,0:48:59.44,中文,,0,0,0,,我们查看输入提交 然后检查遍历的提交是否在已部署的提交中
Dialogue: 0,0:48:59.44,0:49:03.50,英文,,0,0,0,,And the nice thing is that we can actually do step 3 independent of step 1 and 2.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:59.44,0:49:03.50,中文,,0,0,0,,好处是我们可以独立于步骤 1 和 2 来执行步骤 3
Dialogue: 0,0:49:03.50,0:49:11.25,英文,,0,0,0,,Because if I had multiple input commits, maybe I have multiple people coming and asking, hey, which versions are included or have my change in them?
Dialogue: 0,0:49:03.50,0:49:11.25,中文,,0,0,0,,因为如果我有多个输入提交 也许会有多个人来问 嘿 哪些版本包含了我的更改或者有我的更改？
Dialogue: 0,0:49:11.25,0:49:15.53,英文,,0,0,0,,Well, they just give me all of their commits, all of their changes at once, and I can compute it.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:11.25,0:49:15.53,中文,,0,0,0,,好吧 他们只是把他们所有的提交 他们所有的更改一次性给我 我就可以计算出来
Dialogue: 0,0:49:15.53,0:49:17.51,英文,,0,0,0,,via 3 over and over.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:15.53,0:49:17.51,中文,,0,0,0,,通过一遍又一遍地执行步骤 3
Dialogue: 0,0:49:17.51,0:49:21.23,英文,,0,0,0,,So we can do 1 and 2, and then we can run 3 over as many times as needed.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:17.51,0:49:21.23,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们可以做步骤 1 和 2 然后我们可以根据需要多次运行步骤 3
Dialogue: 0,0:49:21.23,0:49:28.85,英文,,0,0,0,,Because in practice, step 1 is the one that takes the longest, just due to the nature of how loading things into your random access memory works.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:21.23,0:49:28.85,中文,,0,0,0,,因为在实践中 步骤 1 是花费时间最长的 这只是由于将东西加载到随机存取存储器的工作原理所致
Dialogue: 0,0:49:28.85,0:49:31.45,英文,,0,0,0,,But it allows us to still work a lot faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:28.85,0:49:31.45,中文,,0,0,0,,但它仍然让我们能够更快地工作
Dialogue: 0,0:49:31.45,0:49:37.45,英文,,0,0,0,,This whole process, maximal time will be roughly on the order of minutes, high seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:31.45,0:49:37.45,中文,,0,0,0,,整个过程 最大时间大约在分钟级 高秒级
Dialogue: 0,0:49:37.45,0:49:43.28,英文,,0,0,0,,But compared to doing it manually, which was basically impossible for millions of commits, it seems a lot better.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:37.45,0:49:43.28,中文,,0,0,0,,但与手动操作相比 手动操作对于数百万次提交来说基本上是不可能的 这似乎要好得多
Dialogue: 0,0:49:43.28,0:49:44.94,英文,,0,0,0,,In some ways, it was obvious and modular.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:43.28,0:49:44.94,中文,,0,0,0,,在某种程度上 它是显而易见的和模块化的
Dialogue: 0,0:49:44.94,0:49:47.34,英文,,0,0,0,,I didn't have to explain to you what the algorithm was.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:44.94,0:49:47.34,中文,,0,0,0,,我不需要向你解释算法是什么
Dialogue: 0,0:49:47.34,0:49:53.14,英文,,0,0,0,,Just by seeing a visual diagram, you were able to get some intuition on how to approach the problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:47.34,0:49:53.14,中文,,0,0,0,,只要看到一个可视化的图表 你就能对如何处理这个问题有一些直觉
Dialogue: 0,0:49:53.14,0:49:54.64,英文,,0,0,0,,Now, this wasn't the entire problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:53.14,0:49:54.64,中文,,0,0,0,,现在 这不是问题的全部
Dialogue: 0,0:49:54.64,0:49:55.40,英文,,0,0,0,,It was a subproblem.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:54.64,0:49:55.40,中文,,0,0,0,,这是一个子问题
Dialogue: 0,0:49:55.40,0:49:57.18,英文,,0,0,0,,But this was the main chunk of that problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:55.40,0:49:57.18,中文,,0,0,0,,但这是那个问题的主要部分
Dialogue: 0,0:49:57.18,0:50:02.87,英文,,0,0,0,,So without getting into the optimizations and details, you were able to solve a lot of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:57.18,0:50:02.87,中文,,0,0,0,,所以 在不深入了解优化和细节的情况下 你已经能够解决很多问题了
Dialogue: 0,0:50:02.87,0:50:03.93,英文,,0,0,0,,Now let's wrap up real quick.
