Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.93,0:00:28.37,中文,,0,0,0,,才四个月
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.37,0:00:32.38,英文,,0,0,0,,So just 14 weeks ago, we were here.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.37,0:00:32.38,中文,,0,0,0,,所以就在14周前  我们还在这里
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.38,0:00:37.60,英文,,0,0,0,,We were just writing our first Hello World in Java.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.38,0:00:37.60,中文,,0,0,0,,我们刚用Java写了第一个Hello World程序
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.60,0:00:41.91,英文,,0,0,0,,And then over the course of those first few weeks, we started learning a bit of how Java worked.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.60,0:00:41.91,中文,,0,0,0,,然后在接下来的几周里  我们开始学习一些Java的工作原理
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.91,0:00:47.01,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked about how objects were created in Java, object-oriented programming.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.91,0:00:47.01,中文,,0,0,0,,我们讨论了如何在Java中创建对象  也就是面向对象编程
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.01,0:00:53.84,英文,,0,0,0,,Unlike Python, Java is the statically typed language where every single variable needs to have a specific type and a specific object class.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.01,0:00:53.84,中文,,0,0,0,,与Python不同  Java是一种静态类型语言  每个变量都需要具有特定的类型和特定的对象类
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.84,0:00:55.18,英文,,0,0,0,,You have these interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.84,0:00:55.18,中文,,0,0,0,,它有接口
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.18,0:01:00.93,英文,,0,0,0,,You have classes, class inheritance, all sorts of things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.18,0:01:00.93,中文,,0,0,0,,它有类、类继承等等
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.93,0:01:04.93,英文,,0,0,0,,Programmers, we try to ensure that we have things as abstracted away as possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.93,0:01:04.93,中文,,0,0,0,,作为程序员  我们尽量确保将事物尽可能地抽象化
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.93,0:01:11.09,英文,,0,0,0,,We don't want to think about all the complex details about how an ArrayList works when all we need is really a List class.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.93,0:01:11.09,中文,,0,0,0,,当我们只需要一个List类时  我们不想考虑ArrayList如何工作的复杂细节
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.09,0:01:15.59,英文,,0,0,0,,So we want to distinguish between when we're the user of a class and when we're actually building the class itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.09,0:01:15.59,中文,,0,0,0,,我们要区分什么时候我们是类的使用者  什么时候我们是类本身的构建者
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.59,0:01:20.55,英文,,0,0,0,,And we want those to be two separate people so we don't have to worry about how the other person behaved.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.59,0:01:20.55,中文,,0,0,0,,我们希望这两者是不同的角色  这样我们就不必担心对方的行为
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.55,0:01:28.22,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked about dynamic versus static typing, how in Java, because of its statically typed language format,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.55,0:01:28.22,中文,,0,0,0,,我们讨论了动态类型和静态类型的区别  在Java中  由于它是静态类型语言格式
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.22,0:01:35.22,英文,,0,0,0,,since every variable needs a type, you can also define its type based on a superclass of what its actual type is.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.22,0:01:35.22,中文,,0,0,0,,因为每个变量都需要一个类型  所以你也可以根据其实际类型的超类来定义它的类型
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.22,0:01:40.28,英文,,0,0,0,,And you can still write code that ends up having that works.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.22,0:01:40.28,中文,,0,0,0,,并且你仍然可以编写最终有效的代码
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.28,0:01:50.93,英文,,0,0,0,,You might have some various type checks in compile time, which are different from the checks that you'll see during actual runtime.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.28,0:01:50.93,中文,,0,0,0,,你可能会在编译时进行一些类型检查  这与你在实际运行时看到的检查不同
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.93,0:01:53.43,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked a bit about how generics work.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.93,0:01:53.43,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还讨论了泛型的原理
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.43,0:01:59.08,英文,,0,0,0,,So in Java, since everything needs to have a particular type, you can't just do arbitrary type objects.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.43,0:01:59.08,中文,,0,0,0,,所以在Java中  由于每样东西都需要有一个特定的类型  所以你不能仅仅使用任意类型的对象
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.08,0:02:09.36,英文,,0,0,0,,So you need to specify exactly, instead of it just being an arbitrary list, you need to specify it's a list of integers or a list of dogs or a list of something else.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.08,0:02:09.36,中文,,0,0,0,,你需要准确地指定  而不是仅仅是一个任意的列表  你需要指定它是一个整数列表、一个狗的列表或其他什么的列表
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.36,0:02:14.10,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked a bit about how arrays are actually just sequences of consecutive memory addresses.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.36,0:02:14.10,中文,,0,0,0,,我们稍微讨论了一下数组实际上是如何连续内存地址的序列
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.10,0:02:18.35,英文,,0,0,0,,They're much faster to use than lists, but they can't be extended as a result.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.10,0:02:18.35,中文,,0,0,0,,它们的使用速度比列表快得多  但结果是它们不能被扩展
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.35,0:02:24.14,英文,,0,0,0,,And that got us into some discussion on how there might be some trade-offs between certain approaches.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.35,0:02:24.14,中文,,0,0,0,,这让我们讨论了一些关于某些方法之间可能存在一些权衡的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.14,0:02:31.52,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked very briefly about how certain integers are represented, a lot about how Java ends up working under the hood.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.14,0:02:31.52,中文,,0,0,0,,我们简要地讨论了某些整数是如何表示的  以及Java最终是如何在底层工作的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.52,0:02:36.10,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked a lot about objects, default methods, iterators, things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.52,0:02:36.10,中文,,0,0,0,,我们讨论了很多关于对象、默认方法、迭代器之类的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.10,0:02:40.64,英文,,0,0,0,,After we finished that, we went into details on collections.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.10,0:02:40.64,中文,,0,0,0,,在完成这些之后  我们详细讨论了集合
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.64,0:02:44.76,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked a bit about a few of these specific data structures that we use a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.64,0:02:44.76,中文,,0,0,0,,我们讨论了一些我们经常使用的数据结构
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.76,0:02:51.04,英文,,0,0,0,,So collections are very common data structures which are designed to store a set of things or a list of things.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.76,0:02:51.04,中文,,0,0,0,,因此  集合是非常常见的数据结构  旨在存储一组东西或一个东西列表
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.04,0:02:54.13,英文,,0,0,0,,So we had maps, lists.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.04,0:02:54.13,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们有映射、列表
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.13,0:03:02.33,英文,,0,0,0,,DQs, and that was our project one, getting us to make an actual DEC class.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.13,0:03:02.33,中文,,0,0,0,,Deque  那是我们的第一个项目  让我们制作一个实际的 DEC 类
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.33,0:03:05.88,英文,,0,0,0,,We went into a bit of detail about the math behind actually what we're doing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.33,0:03:05.88,中文,,0,0,0,,我们详细讨论了我们实际工作背后的数学原理
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.88,0:03:16.54,英文,,0,0,0,,We talked a lot about asymptotic analysis, O bounds, omega bounds, theta bounds, and how those are different from worst case, average case, best case operations.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.88,0:03:16.54,中文,,0,0,0,,我们讨论了很多关于渐近分析、O界限、Ω界限、Θ界限  以及它们与最坏情况、平均情况、最佳情况操作的不同之处
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.54,0:03:24.01,英文,,0,0,0,,And we saw throughout the semester a lot of different approaches in how certain bounds might have different use cases.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.54,0:03:24.01,中文,,0,0,0,,\N在整个学期中  我们看到了很多不同的方法  来处理某些情况下界限可能有不同用例的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.01,0:03:31.11,英文,,0,0,0,,For example, when you're looking at an array list, you're really looking at the average case runtime when you're looking at the amortized bound.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.01,0:03:31.11,中文,,0,0,0,,例如  当你查看数组列表时  你实际上是在查看摊销界限时的平均情况运行时间
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.11,0:03:35.46,英文,,0,0,0,,Because an array list, it's still slowest worst case theta n time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.11,0:03:35.46,中文,,0,0,0,,因为数组列表  它仍然是最慢的最坏情况 Θ(N) 时间
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.46,0:03:40.66,英文,,0,0,0,,But that happens so infrequently that we can actually get theta 1 amortized time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.46,0:03:40.66,中文,,0,0,0,,但这种情况很少发生  所以我们实际上可以得到 Θ(1) 摊销时间
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.66,0:03:47.54,英文,,0,0,0,,Quick Start was another big example where we saw that, on average, in a random case, you're generally going to get n log n time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.66,0:03:47.54,中文,,0,0,0,,快速排序是另一个重要的例子  我们看到  平均而言  在随机情况下  你通常会得到 N log N 的时间
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.54,0:03:54.50,英文,,0,0,0,,But on those very, very unlucky cases, you end up getting n squared run time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.54,0:03:54.50,中文,,0,0,0,,但在那些非常非常不幸运的情况下  你最终会得到 N² 的运行时间
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.50,0:03:59.42,英文,,0,0,0,,We did try to look at some code and try and figure out the actual runtime.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.50,0:03:59.42,中文,,0,0,0,,我们确实尝试查看了一些代码  并试图找出实际的运行时间
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.42,0:04:03.10,英文,,0,0,0,,But it tends to be quite difficult to do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.42,0:04:03.10,中文,,0,0,0,,但这往往很难做到
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.10,0:04:08.03,英文,,0,0,0,,It uses a lot more math than in 61A, for example, you might see.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.10,0:04:08.03,中文,,0,0,0,,它使用的数学知识比 61A 课程中多很多  例如  你可能会看到
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.03,0:04:12.77,英文,,0,0,0,,But comparable math to how you might see in CS70 or CS170.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.03,0:04:12.77,中文,,0,0,0,,但与 CS70 或 CS170 中看到的数学知识相当
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.77,0:04:19.06,英文,,0,0,0,,And we also use this specifically when looking at ArrayList to show that when you do this multiplicative resizing,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.77,0:04:19.06,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还专门在研究 ArrayList 时使用了这一点  以表明当你进行这种乘法扩容时
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.06,0:04:23.06,英文,,0,0,0,,those resizes are so rare that you get theta 1 amortized time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.06,0:04:23.06,中文,,0,0,0,,这些扩容非常少见  以至于你得到了 Θ(1) 的摊销时间
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.06,0:04:28.98,英文,,0,0,0,,But when you do additive resizing, you end up getting theta n average runtime.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.06,0:04:28.98,中文,,0,0,0,,但是当你进行加法扩容时  最终会得到 Θ(n) 的平均运行时间
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.98,0:04:32.91,英文,,0,0,0,,Here's kind of a list of all the data structures that we looked at throughout this course.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.98,0:04:32.91,中文,,0,0,0,,以下是我们在本课程中所学到的所有数据结构的列表
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.91,0:04:38.21,英文,,0,0,0,,We had sets, maps, priority queues, lists, disjoint sets, graphs.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.91,0:04:38.21,中文,,0,0,0,,我们有集合、映射、优先队列、列表、不相交集、图
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.21,0:04:41.75,英文,,0,0,0,,And we also looked at a lot of different approaches on how to implement them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.21,0:04:41.75,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还研究了许多不同的实现方法
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.75,0:04:45.77,英文,,0,0,0,,We saw that, for example, we could implement a priority queue with a balanced tree or with a heap.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.75,0:04:45.77,中文,,0,0,0,,例如  我们看到可以使用平衡树或堆来实现优先队列
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.77,0:04:50.31,英文,,0,0,0,,We also saw we could implement it with an ordered linked list, but that was way, way slower.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.77,0:04:50.31,中文,,0,0,0,,我们还看到可以使用有序链表来实现它  但这要慢得多
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.31,0:04:52.26,英文,,0,0,0,,So we generally don't do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.31,0:04:52.26,中文,,0,0,0,,所以我们一般不这样做
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.26,0:04:53.36,英文,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.26,0:04:53.36,中文,,0,0,0,,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.36,0:05:01.48,英文,,0,0,0,,So here's all the blue ones are the ones that we found that were efficient enough that we could actually use it in real life.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.36,0:05:01.48,中文,,0,0,0,,这里所有蓝色的都是我们发现效率足够高  可以在现实生活中实际使用的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.48,0:05:10.46,英文,,0,0,0,,The red ones are the ones which are just so slow that they're not really useful, not practical for our purposes.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.48,0:05:10.46,中文,,0,0,0,,红色的那些太慢了  以至于它们不是很有用  对我们的目的来说不实用
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.46,0:05:14.64,英文,,0,0,0,,So we had these array-based data structures versus linked list data structures.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.46,0:05:14.64,中文,,0,0,0,,我们有这些基于数组的数据结构和基于链表的数据结构
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.64,0:05:19.50,英文,,0,0,0,,Array lists, they're really good at accessing an arbitrary point in the item.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.64,0:05:19.50,中文,,0,0,0,,数组列表非常擅长访问项目中的任意点
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.50,0:05:26.32,英文,,0,0,0,,But linked lists are also really good at pointing out at a very specific point or adding a new item in between two things.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.50,0:05:26.32,中文,,0,0,0,,但链表也确实擅长指向一个非常具体的点  或者在两件事之间添加一个新项目
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.32,0:05:31.42,英文,,0,0,0,,So because of that, you end up seeing array-based options when you want to have constant time accesses.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.32,0:05:31.42,中文,,0,0,0,,因此  当你想要进行常数时间访问时  最终会看到基于数组的选项
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.42,0:05:39.53,英文,,0,0,0,,And you will see linked list structures like trees or graphs when you want to have easy insertions of any arbitrary location in the list.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.42,0:05:39.53,中文,,0,0,0,,当你想要在列表中的任意位置轻松插入时  你会看到链表结构  例如树或图
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.53,0:05:41.45,英文,,0,0,0,,So you had these trade-offs.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.53,0:05:41.45,中文,,0,0,0,,你必须进行权衡
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.45,0:05:48.79,英文,,0,0,0,,And we saw a lot of data structures which had one advantage or another.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.45,0:05:48.79,中文,,0,0,0,,我们也见识了很多各有利弊的数据结构
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.79,0:05:55.75,英文,,0,0,0,,At the very end, we also looked at a lot of these graph algorithms, topological sort, reachability, all of these different possible things.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.79,0:05:55.75,中文,,0,0,0,,最后  我们还研究了许多图算法  比如拓扑排序、可达性等等
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.75,0:05:58.91,英文,,0,0,0,,Minimum spanning tree was a big one that we found.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.75,0:05:58.91,中文,,0,0,0,,最小生成树是我们发现的一个重要算法
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.91,0:06:02.92,英文,,0,0,0,,And we showed that some of these were actually really easy to solve.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.91,0:06:02.92,中文,,0,0,0,,我们发现其中一些算法其实很容易解决

Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.45,0:06:08.67,英文,,0,0,0,,But some of these can't.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.45,0:06:08.67,中文,,0,0,0,,但也有些问题无法做到
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.67,0:06:12.81,英文,,0,0,0,,Longest path, for example, is something that you just can't solve in polynomial time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.67,0:06:12.81,中文,,0,0,0,,例如  最长路径问题就无法在多项式时间内解决
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.81,0:06:17.98,英文,,0,0,0,,And we kind of discussed that briefly in our P versus NP lecture.
